<p><span class="firstword">The</span> <i>views</i> which I have given of the important points on
the line of the Croton Aqueduct, are from sketches taken
for my own satisfaction; but the interest so generally taken
in the work, has suggested to me the propriety of presenting
them to the public in this form. Having been engaged in
the Engineer Department during the whole of the construction
of the Aqueduct, my acquaintance with it would
enable me to present more of its details; but I have given
those of the construction of the Aqueduct, and a general
<i>outline</i> of the structures connected with it, trusting that a
more detailed description may emanate from <span class="smcap">John B. Jervis</span>,
Esquire, who, as Chief Engineer, gave <i>Plans</i> and <i>Specifications</i>
for the work during its construction.</p>

<p>A description from such source, accompanied with detailed
plans of all the appurtenances of the Aqueduct, with the
results of experiments on the flow of water in the Aqueduct,
would be a useful contribution to the cause of science, a
valuable work to Engineers generally, and particularly so to
younger members of the profession.</p>

<p>The history which I have given of the preliminary
measures leading to the accomplishment of this work, has
been obtained, mainly, from printed documents of the
Common Council. I have also had conversations with persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
who were intimately concerned in some of those measures,
and trust that I have made the history sufficiently full
to embrace the leading steps which were taken.</p>

<p>The accounts of the Aqueducts of ancient Rome, and
those built by the ancient Romans in other parts of Europe,
also that of the Aqueducts of modern Rome, of Italy, France,
&amp;c., have been mostly obtained from the French work of
<span class="smcap">J. Rondolet</span>, in which the account of the Aqueducts of
ancient Rome is translated from the Latin of Frontinus.</p>

<p>For the account of the Aqueducts of Mexico and South
America, I am indebted, in a great degree, to “<i>Bradford’s
Antiquities of America</i>,” and “<i>Ewbank’s Hydraulics</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="firstword">A supply</span> of pure and wholesome water is an object so
essential to the health and prosperity of a city, that it should
form one of the leading features of the public improvements
which characterize its growth. The advantages arising from
it are so numerous, and the comforts so great, that every
effort should be made to accomplish it.</p>

<p>The means which have been resorted to for such purposes
in almost every city of importance in the Old World, are
examples for us of the <i>New</i>, and should induce us early to
avail ourselves of that important element of health. We
contemplate with mingled emotions of wonder and admiration,
those works of art which were achieved by ancient
Rome in her palmy days of wealth and power, and among
them we find that her <i>Aqueducts</i> hold a prominent place.</p>

<p>Among the ruins of cities whose history is shrouded in
mystery on this continent, we find provisions for bringing
water from distant sources. In the wilds of Central America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the persevering traveller finds ruined cities buried in the
depths of the forest, where nature is at work covering and
concealing them: among those ruins he tells us of the <i>Aqueduct</i>.
We find them also among the ruins of cities along the
western coast of South America. With such examples before
us, we may consider that by the construction of the
Croton Aqueduct for supplying the City of New-York with
water has been secured an important measure for the promotion
of its growth.</p>

<p>Many cities of the United States have directed their attention
to this object, and some have been fortunate in finding a
supply of water near at hand, but others will look towards
distant sources for a supply, and will, ere long, resort to the
construction of <i>Aqueducts</i>.</p>

<p>In the history of cities built in remote periods of antiquity,
we find mention made of plans for supplying water, and
among remains of those cities which are found at this day,
are traces of Aqueducts. We have accounts of Aqueducts
constructed under the reign of Solomon, and the remains
of them still existing in Palestine, give evidence of an extensive
acquaintance with the principles of hydraulics among
the Hebrew architects. The Pools of Solomon, which are
mentioned by travellers who combine in their researches a
regard for the arts as well as the religion of Judea, are
connected with a scheme for supplying Jerusalem with
water.</p>

<p>The vast expense incurred in the construction of Aqueducts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
by the Ancient Romans, as well in Italy as in other
countries of Europe, proves the value that was attached by
that people to a plentiful supply of pure water, and the details
of the plan of construction of the different works, evince
an acquaintance with the principles of hydraulics which,
at this day, is not generally accorded to them. That they
understood the principle that water seeks the level of its
source after encountering depressions in its conduit, is sufficiently
proved by instances, in works constructed by them,
where the inverted syphon of pipes was used in crossing
valleys. That this plan was not <i>generally</i> adopted by them
in cases where great expense has been incurred to maintain
the uniform declivity of the conduit over valleys, may be accounted
for perhaps by the want of proper material for the
construction of pipes. In cases where this plan has been
adopted leaden pipes were used, and since it is only within
the last century that iron pipes have been invented, we may
reasonably conclude that considerations of such a nature
would have induced them to adopt the more expensive plan
of maintaining the general inclination of the conduit by vast
structures of masonry.</p>

<p>By substituting inverted syphons instead of maintaining a
uniform declivity in the conduit, would not give the requisite
discharge of water at the elevation of the <i>terminus</i> of the
Aqueduct, and perhaps they preferred, rather than diminish
this elevation of the supply of water, to incur the expense of
high structures across valleys. The Roman Emperors, with
all their power and the wealth which was at their command,
knew how to perpetuate the glory of their reign by the erection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of Temples, Palaces and other public buildings, and
what is more natural than to suppose that in the construction
of these Aqueducts, which were considered so essential to
the public welfare, they should encourage works of such
architectural magnificence? Whatever the reasons might
have been for maintaining the elevation of their Aqueducts
over valleys by such expensive structures, we have no
right to charge them with the want of that knowledge which
the plan of <i>some</i> of their Aqueducts clearly proves them to
have possessed.</p>

<p>Trusting that it will be interesting to the reader, I shall present
an account of some of the principal Aqueducts built by
the Ancient Romans,—some of the modern Aqueducts of
Italy and France; also of Aqueducts in other parts of the
world. This account might be enlarged, to embrace a description
of more of the modern Aqueducts of Europe; but
sufficient will be presented, it is thought, to interest without
detaining the reader too long in arriving at the principal
object of this work,—<i>a description of the Croton Aqueduct</i>.</p>

<p>A view is given of the Aqueduct of Spoleto, in Italy. The
bridge supporting this Aqueduct is remarkable for the slender
form of the piers and their great height; being only
ten and a half feet thick and two hundred and fifty feet
high to the base of the arches. This Aqueduct was built
by the Goths, a people who gave a model for Church Architecture
which is much admired at the present day. It
is said that they borrowed the idea of the form of their
arch from the opening beneath an arbor of trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>The plan of the bridge for the Croton Aqueduct at
Harlem River has been criticised on account of the small
thickness of the piers as compared with their height, and
because they were not made piers of equilibrium; that is to
say, having their bases broader, so as to include the line
of thrust of the arches, so that if a portion of the bridge
were removed, the remainder of the arches and piers would
maintain their position. By the present plan the permanency
of any one individual arch may be considered to depend
upon that of the whole structure.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>The Aqueduct of Spoleto, has been standing about eleven
hundred years and is still in a perfect state of preservation.</p>

<p>With proper care in preparing the foundations of the
bridge at Harlem River, there is no good reason to fear
that it will be less durable than that of Spoleto.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_13"><span class="smcap">Aqueducts of Ancient Rome.</span></h3>

<p>The largest and most magnificent Aqueducts of which
we have any account, were the work of the Romans; and
the ruins of several of them, both in Italy, and other countries
of Europe, remain to the present time monuments of the
power and industry of that enterprising people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>For 440 years from the foundation of Rome the inhabitants
contented themselves with the waters of the Tiber,
and of the wells and fountains in the city and its neighborhood.
But at that period the number of houses and inhabitants
had so augmented, that they were obliged to bring
water from distant sources by means of Aqueducts. Appius
commenced this scheme of improvement. About 39 years
after him, M. Curius Dentatus, who was censor with Papirius
Cursor, brought water from the neighborhood of the
city of Tibur; and applied towards defraying the expense,
part of the sums taken in the spoils of Pyrrhus. After them
Lucius Papirius, Caius Servillius Cepion, Lucius Longinus
Crassus, Quintus Marcius, (who brought water to Rome
from a spring at the distance of nearly sixty miles,) Marcus
Agrippa, Augustus, and others, signalized themselves by
their noble Aqueducts. Even Tiberius, Claudius, Caligula,
and Carracalla, though in other respects not of the best character,
took care of the city in this useful article.</p>

<p>In the remains of these ancient Aqueducts, some are elevated
above the ground upon a solid mass of stone work, or
upon arches continued and raised one above the other; other
portions are subterraneous, passing through deep excavations,
and in many instances piercing through mountains of rock;
such is that seen at Vicovaro beyond Tivoli, where a <i>tunnel</i>
of about five feet deep and four broad, pierces a rock for a
distance of more than a mile.</p>

<p>These Aqueducts were generally built of stone and
covered by arches or large flat stones. At certain distances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
vents were provided to discharge the water from the channel-way;
and cavities were formed, into which the water was
precipitated, and where it remained till its mud was deposited,
and ponds in which it might purify itself.</p>

<p>One of these Aqueducts was formed with two channels,
one above the other: they were, however, constructed at
different periods; the most elevated was supplied by the
waters of the Tiverone, <i>Anio novus</i>, and the lower one
by the <i>Claudian</i> water. It is represented by Pliny, as the
most beautiful of all that had been built for the use of
Rome. It was begun by Caligula, and finished by Claudius,
who brought its waters from two springs called Cœruleus
and Curtius. Vespian, Titus, Marcus-Aurelius, and Antonius
Pius, repaired and extended it; it is now called <i>Aqua
Felice</i>.</p>

<p>The Aqueduct that conveyed the Aqua Neroniana to
Rome, was built of brick; this, as well as the former, was
in some instances 70 Roman feet high.</p>

<p>The Aqueduct that brought the <i>Aqua Marcia</i> into the
city was repaired by Agrippa, who laid pipes from it to
several parts of the city.</p>

<p>The <i>Aqua Marcia</i>, <i>Aqua Julia</i>, <i>Aqua Tepula</i>, entered
Rome in one and the same Aqueduct, divided into three
ranges or stories; in the uppermost of which flowed the
<i>Aqua Julia</i>, in the second the <i>Aqua Tepula</i>, and in the lowest
the <i>Aqua Marcia</i>. This accounts for the extraordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
height of this Aqueduct, which far surpassed that of any
other in Rome. From the ruins of this fabric, which are
still seen, and are called “<i>Il castel del Acqua Marcia</i>,” it
appears to have been a very superb structure.</p>

<p>The Aqueducts were under the care and direction, first of
the censors and œdiles, and afterwards, of particular magistrates
called “Curatores Aquarum,” instituted by Agrippa,
to whom the Aqueducts of Rome were objects of particular
attention. Messala was one of these curatores in the reign
of Augustus, and Frontinus held the same office in that of
Nerva. Augustus caused all of them to be repaired.</p>

<p>Procopius reckons only fourteen Aqueducts in ancient
Rome; but Victor has enlarged the number to twenty.</p>

<p>Frontinus, a man of consular dignity, and who had the
direction of the Aqueducts under the Emperor Nerva, mentions
nine. From other accounts we are informed that nine
great Aqueducts existed at Rome at the commencement of
the reign of Nerva. Five others were constructed by that
Emperor, under the superintendence of Julius Frontinus;
and it appears that at a later period the number amounted to
twenty.</p>

<p>Frontinus, who had the superintendence of the Roman
Aqueducts under the Emperor Nerva, died A. D. 101. He
gave an account of the Aqueducts, which has since been
translated into French by Rondolet. The following table
is made up of data from that work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>The table is arranged to show, <i>First</i>, the name of the
water or Aqueduct; <i>Second</i>, the era of its construction;
<i>Third</i>, the length of each Aqueduct in miles and decimals;
<i>Fourth</i>, the cubic feet discharged in 24 hours, and <i>Fifth</i>, the
gallons in wine measure.</p>

<p>Some auxiliary supplies or feeders make the total length
of the Roman Aqueducts, at that period, exceed 255 miles.</p>

<p>The names of the Roman Aqueducts are taken from
those of the River or Lake which supplies them, or from
the emperors who caused them to be constructed. Frontinus
gives the following as the origin of the name <i>Virgin
Aqueduct</i>: “It is called the Virgin (Virgo), because it was
a young girl who showed some veins to a few soldiers who
were in search of spring water. Those who dug followed
these veins and found a great quantity, and there is a painting
in a little temple erected close by the source representing
this event.”</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Nismes.</i></h3>

<p>This is probably one of the most ancient Aqueducts constructed,
out of Rome, by the Romans. It is attributed to
Agrippa, son-in-law of Augustus, to whom that emperor gave
the government of the country becoming a Roman Colony.</p>

<p>Agrippa, flattered by the honors which he received from
the inhabitants of Nismes, made his residence there: he enclosed
the town with new walls, built baths, and probably the
Aqueduct of the bridge of Gard (“<i>pont du Gard</i>”) for bringing
water to them.</p>

<p>This Aqueduct is nearly thirty miles in length, forming, in
its course, the figure of a horse-shoe. It brought water from
the fountains of Eura and Airan, situated in the neighborhood
of the town of <i>Uzès</i>. The bridge of Gard was about
the middle part of the work, and the Aqueduct terminated at
Nismes.</p>

<p>This Aqueduct traversed a very mountainous country,
piercing through mountains and crossing valleys by means
of arches upon arches, forming magnificent structures entirely
of cut stone. The Aqueduct or channel-way is formed
of stone throughout the whole length. The bottom of the
interior has a curved form, being an arc of a circle; the sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
are vertical, and the top covered with a flagging of cut stone,
except where it is under ground, in which situation the top is
covered by an arch of stone. The interior face of the walls
and the bottom were covered with a coat of plastering two
inches in thickness, composed of quick-lime, fine sand, and
brick nearly pulverized. This coating has now a tenacity
and consistence equal to the hardest stone.</p>

<p>The size of the channel-way is the following: 4 feet wide
and 5⅓ feet high, except where the top is covered with an
arch, in which case it is 7½ feet high in the interior.</p>

<p>The descent of the Aqueduct is 1 foot in 2500 feet, or 2-11/100
feet per mile.</p>

<p>The water which flowed in this Aqueduct formed a deposit
upon the sides, of lime, until nearly half the channel was
closed; this deposit amounting to a thickness of 11 inches on
each side. By the height of this deposit it has been ascertained
that the water flowed generally with a depth of 3¼ feet.</p>

<p>The <i>pont du Gard</i> is that part of the Aqueduct of Nismes
which crosses the deep valley in which runs the <i>Gardon</i>
or <i>Gard</i>. This part, considered alone, is one of the
noblest monuments built by the Romans among the Gauls.
It is composed of three ranges of arches one above another.
The first range, under which the Gardon flows, is formed
by 6 arches; the second by 11, and the third by 35, all of
which are semicircular; supported upon piers of greater or
less height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The channel in which the water flows is upon the top of
the third range of arches, and is 160 feet above the water of
the river. The whole length of this bridge is about 900 feet.</p>

<p>The bridge of Gard having been broken down at the two
extremities, at a period very remote and uncertain, it is
thought that this destruction may be attributed to the Barbarians
who invaded the country of Nismes a short time
after their first invasion, which is fixed at the commencement
of the fifth century, about the year 406, and it is supposed
that by this means they would deprive the inhabitants of
Nismes of the water furnished by the Aqueduct, and force
them to yield. But by this supposition, which is very probable,
the water had been running in this Aqueduct for more
than four centuries; and this structure which has been out
of use during fourteen hundred years, is still in such a state
of preservation that it could be restored without a very great
expenditure of money.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ancient Aqueducts of Lyons.</span></h3>

<p>Nothing gives a better idea of the splendour of the city of
Lyons under the reign of the first Roman Emperors, than
the remains of the ancient monuments. We see there at
the present day, remains of temples, of palaces, of amphitheatres,
of basins for mock sea fights, of baths and of many
Aqueducts, of which three were constructed under the reigns
of Augustus, of Tiberius and of Claudius, for conducting
water to that part of the ancient city situated upon the
mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>The first and the most ancient of these Aqueducts, constructed
by Mark Anthony, brought the waters from <i>Mount-d’Or</i>,
by means of two branches which embraced that group
of mountains.</p>

<p>The water furnished by the first Aqueduct having been
found insufficient, they constructed a second one to bring the
water of the Loire.</p>

<p>The third Aqueduct was built by the Emperor Claudius
to furnish water to the palace of the emperors situated
upon an elevated mountain. The Aqueducts built at this
era are all of the same construction; that is to say, from
the plan and construction adopted by the Romans. A fourth
Aqueduct was also constructed for this city, but there is
some doubt whether it was built by the Romans.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Aqueduct of Mount Pila.</span></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was built by Claudius, who was born at
Lyons, to conduct water to the emperor’s palace, situated
on the highest part of the city. The sources which supplied
it, were in the neighbourhood of Mount Pila, and they were
brought into the main Aqueduct by branch aqueducts. The
main Aqueduct was forty miles in length; and adding the
branches, the length of the Aqueduct was forty-five miles.</p>

<p>There were 13 bridges of stone to support the Aqueduct
across valleys or over rivers, two of which were not built
up to the plane of the Aqueduct, but were crossed by leaden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
pipes which descended on one side of the valley and,
crossing the bridge, ascended on the opposite side. In
another instance the pipes descended and crossed upon a
wall of masonry and reached the opposite side of the valley.
One instance, where pipes were used, will give an idea of
their general form: the bridge was about 40 feet high and
the perpendicular height of the Aqueduct above it was 140
feet. Nine leaden pipes of about 8 inches interior diameter
and one inch thick were laid upon the inclined planes and
across the level part of the bridge; thus communicating
with the opposite crests of the valley.</p>

<p>These bridges which were constructed for the support of
pipes, were wider in the bottom of the valley and also half
way up the inclined plane, than they were for the remainder
of the distance; and this form has suggested the idea that
the pipes of 8 inches diameter, when they reached half
way down the plane, separated, each one into two of 6 inches
diameter which crossed the bridge, and converged into one
again half way up the opposite plane. But it may be supposed
that they continued of the same interior form throughout
their length, and that this extra width was made for the
purpose of giving an opportunity to fortify the pipes at the
place where the pressure to which they were subjected was
the greatest.</p>

<h4><i>Construction.</i></h4>

<p>They commenced the construction by making a trench in
the ground of sufficient dimensions for the masonry of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Aqueduct: upon the bottom of this trench was laid a mass
of masonry 1 foot thick, upon which two walls were built,
each 1½ foot thick and 5⅓ feet high, these walls standing 2
feet apart, and surmounted by a semicircular arch of a thickness
of 1 foot and generally covered with earth 2 feet deep.
The interior had a coat of cement plastering, 6 inches thick
on the bottom and 1½ inch thick on the sides. The walls
were constructed with small stones from 3 to 6 inches in
thickness, bedded in mortar so that no spaces could be found
between them. They avoided the use of stones of greater
thickness than 6 inches, because the walls built of small
stones, well filled with mortar, formed a mass more solid
and impervious than with larger stones, on account of the
great quantity of mortar used.</p>

<p>No bricks were used in the construction of the channel-way
of the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>Ventilators were constructed along the course of the
Aqueduct 2 feet square, and rising above the ground 2 or 3
feet. The Aqueduct when it was above the ground, was
supported upon a wall of masonry, and the side walls of the
channel-way had an increased thickness. When it was
elevated 6 or 7 feet above the ground, the foundation wall
was six feet thick; but when it had a greater elevation it
was supported upon arches and piers, and upon the elevation
depended the span of the arch, the thickness and height of
the piers. The general declivity in the channel-way, was
1 foot in 640, or about 8¼ feet per mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>This Aqueduct supplied about 1,200,000 gallons of water
in 24 hours. The velocity of the water was about five times
that of the water in the Aqueducts of Rome.</p>

<p>This work was constructed at an immense expense, and in
substituting the “<i>inverted syphon</i>,” for high structures across
valleys, there is evidence of the intelligence and skill of those
who had charge of the construction.</p>

<p>A fragment of a pipe forming part of this reversed syphon,
is still preserved in the museum at Lyons, and an instance of
the Romans having laid pipes across the beds of rivers, is
given by M. Gautier, Architect, Engineer, &amp;c., in his work
called “<i>Traité de la Construction des Chemins</i>,” published
in 1778.</p>

<p>About 70 or 80 years ago, he was directed by Mr. Pontchartrain,
Minister of State, to repair to Rochefort, to conduct
spring water to the port from the fountains of the city,
which were supplied from a source, though quite insufficient
for the city, in the neighborhood. In his researches he discovered
a good and copious source, at less than half a league,
but on the other side of the river, the Charente. Many
difficulties were presented, because at low water vessels
might ground upon the pipes and injure them.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Gautier proposed to lay down two leaden
pipes, to preserve a supply in case of accident to one,
and to protect them by wooden frames in an effectual way
against injury, should vessels lay upon the defence frames<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
during low water. Mr. Begon, intendant of the Marine,
approved the plan, but it was finally rejected.</p>

<p>“Some years after,” says Mr. Gautier, “when I had charge
of the roads on the Rhone, and of many other works in the
Province of Languedoc, and while at Arles, I heard that a
vessel had cast anchor in the Rhone, opposite the city, to
take some loading; but when the commander wanted to
sail again he could not raise the anchor. This fact attracted
much attention, and many people went to witness the singular
circumstance. The Captain, unwilling to lose his anchor,
sent down a man, to find what was the matter. The diver
reported that the anchor was hooked under something round,
but he could not tell what it was. A capstan was applied
to raise it, which succeeded.</p>

<p>It brought up a leaden conduit pipe from the bottom of
the Rhone, which crossed it from the City of Arles, towards
Trinquetaillade, over a breadth of about 90 toises (576 feet)
in a depth of 6 or 7 toises (about 40 feet,) the deepest part
of the Rhone. I saw some pieces of this conduit of lead,
5 or 6 inches in diameter, about 4 lines (one third of an inch)
thick, in joints of 1 toise each soldered lengthwise, and
covered by a strip or sheet of lead of the same thickness
covering the first solder about 2 inches. The conduit was
soldered at the joints, 6 feet apart, by the same material,
which made a swell at that distance. On each joint were
these words in relief <b>C. CANTIUS POIHINUS. F.</b> which
was apparently the name of the maker or architect, who laid
down the conduit pipe in the time of the Romans. I delayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
not to inform Mr. Begon, at Rochefort, of this discovery,
because he had always favoured my project of conducting
water along the bottom and across the Charente, which would
not have been half so difficult as it had no doubt been, to lay
one across the Rhone where this was found.</p>

<p>Hence it may be believed, as I think now myself, that
many things supposed now-a-days to be new and never to
have been previously invented, may have been thought of
long before, even in remote ages.” Pp. 129, 130.</p>

<h3><i>Ancient Aqueduct of Metz.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was built by the Romans when that city
was under their dominion; but it is difficult to fix upon the
precise era of its construction. It is said in the history of
the city of Metz that the Roman legions built roads in the
year 70; but there is reason to suppose that the construction
of this Aqueduct, as well as that of other important
structures built by the Romans at Metz, belongs to a time
more remote, and that the date of the reign of the first emperors
may be the era when the legions of Cæsar occupied
the country of the Gauls.</p>

<p>The total length of the Aqueduct was 14 miles, and the
fall for this distance was about 73 feet.</p>

<p>The channel-way was 6⅓ feet high, by 3 feet wide, constructed
with stone masonry and having an arch over the
top: the interior face of the walls and the bottom was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
covered with a coat of plastering; 3 inches thick in the bottom,
and 2 inches on the sides. From remains of this
Aqueduct which are now found at various points along its
course, it appears to have required many expensive structures
for crossing valleys; in one instance the Aqueduct
bridge was 3,600 feet long, and the greatest height was 100
feet. In constructing the Aqueduct over these bridges, they
formed it in two channels separated by a wall, and each
covered with an arch; thus they insured a supply of water
across the bridge by one channel in case the other required
repairs.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Bourgas, near Constantinople.</i></h3>

<p>Three Aqueducts exist in the valley of Bourgas, 8 miles
from Constantinople, for conducting water into the city.
One of them is remarkable for the beautiful architectural
arrangement and the solidity of its construction. It is 115
feet high, and was built under the Emperor Justinian, A. D.
527. It has two ranges of arches, one above the other, and
the Aqueduct supported upon the second. These Aqueducts
are in some parts unlike those of Rome, which were formed
on a continuous line for many miles, with a regular inclination
from the source to the city, but are interrupted by reversed
syphons. Instead of crossing deep and wide valleys
in the usual manner of stone structures, the Aqueduct terminates
on one bank in a reservoir or cistern, and a pipe is
laid from it down the sloping side of the hill to a stone pier
erected at a suitable distance; the pipe rises up the pier to
the top where the water is discharged into a small cistern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
nearly as high as that in the reservoir. From the cistern,
another conduit pipe descends to the bottom of the pier,
passes along the ground to a second pier at a proper distance
and rises to another cistern on the top of it, and so on
till it rises on the crest of the opposite bank, where the water
resumes its regular motion along the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>This plan was probably adopted with a view to avoid the
expense of constructing a bridge which should preserve the
general inclination of the channel-way; but it is difficult to
imagine any advantage arising from the construction of the
piers, instead of laying the pipe along the bottom of the valley.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_28"><i>Modern Rome.</i></h3>

<p>Rome is now supplied with water by three Aqueducts,
being three of the ancient works restored in modern times.</p>

<p>First, <i>Aqua Virgini</i>, called by Frontinus, Aqua Virgo, or
<i>Virgin Aqueduct</i>.</p>

<p>The trunk of the Aqueduct having been injured, the reparation
was began under the Pontificate of Nicholas V. and
Sextus IV., and completed under that of Pius IV. in 1568.
This water supplies the beautiful fountain Trevi, thus named
from the three discharges issuing from it, or from its being
placed at the junction of three streets. The water this
Aqueduct furnishes is 2,322,762 cubic feet (14,168,848 gallons)
daily, discharging through 7 principal conduits, at 13
public and 37 other fountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Second, <i>Aqua Felice</i>. This is a part of the ancient
water of the Claudian and Marcian Aqueducts united with
many others, and collected under Sextus V. The daily
quantity it furnishes is 727,161 cubic feet, (4,435,682 gallons,)
and supplies 16 public and 11 other fountains. The
Moses fountain discharges from this source.</p>

<p>The Pauline Aqueduct, called <i>Aqua Paola</i>, is the third of
the ancient works restored. The water is collected within
the territories of Arcolo and Bassano, and conducted along
the ancient Aqueduct of Alsietina. This was effected under
Pope Pius V., and directed by Charles Fontana, an eminent
Hydraulic Architect, who constructed the great fountain of
S. Pietro-in-Montorio. Additional water was also taken
from Lake Bracciano by Fontana in 1694, under Clement
X. The whole quantity in 24 hours is 3,325,531 cubic feet,
(20,285,739 gallons,) about one third of which goes to feed
the fountains of St. Peters, and those of the Pontifical Palace
on the Vatican Hill; the rest is distributed among 8
public and 23 other fountains, as well as to 21 work-shops,
(<i>usines</i>) in St. Pancras-street.</p>

<p>An evidence of the durability of these old Roman structures
is furnished in this junction of water from Lake Bracciano
by Cardinal Orsini, under authority of Clement X.,
upon condition that a part of the water should be used to
feed a second fountain about to be built in St. Peter’s Square
at Rome, and the rest to be divided between the Apostolic
Chamber and the House of Orsini. From the lake the conduit
leads to the old Alsietina Aqueduct, in which it flows 20<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
miles to the city, and it was found to be in so perfect a state
when the trial was first made after the restoration, October
13th, 1693, that all the water which entered the old Aqueduct
was discharged at Rome without any loss, after its use had
been suspended nearly 1000 years.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Principal_Modern_Aqueducts_of_Italy_France_Etc"><span class="smcap">The Principal Modern Aqueducts of Italy, France, Etc.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Caserta.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was built by the order of the King of Naples,
Charles III., for conducting water to his residence
which he had at Caserta, a town situated about fifteen miles
north of Naples.</p>

<p>This Aqueduct was commenced in 1753. It is twenty-seven
miles long, from the sources which supply it to the
gardens of Caserta. The sources are at the base of the
mountain called <i>Taburno</i>; the principal one is called <i>Sorgente
de la Sfizzo</i>; it is afterwards joined by streams from
many other sources, which are in the country called
<i>Airola</i>.</p>

<p>These waters are all joined in one Aqueduct, crossing the
river <i>Faënza</i>, upon a bridge of three arches, built in 1753.
Again, in the valley of <i>Durazzano</i>, there is another bridge
of three arches, upon which the Aqueduct crosses the valley,
passing over the river, and extending from the mountain
called <i>Santa Agata de’Goti</i>, to the mountain of <i>Durazzano</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>This Aqueduct afterwards crosses a deep valley, which it
meets between <i>Monte-Longano</i> and the hills <i>Tifata</i>, where
ancient Caserta is situated, about the place called <i>Monte di
Gazzano</i>. The crossing of this valley required the most
important of all the constructions connected with the work.
It was accomplished by an Aqueduct bridge, 1724 feet long
and 190 feet in height, composed of three tiers of arches,
one above another. The lower range has nineteen arches,
the middle twenty-seven, and the upper one forty-three; making
in all eighty-nine arches.</p>

<p>The labor of constructions under ground for this Aqueduct
was more than that above; it pierced through five hills
or mountains, making an aggregate length of tunnel of about
four miles, and most of this was through rock.</p>

<p>To give air and light to the channel, they made pits or
wells; some of which were 250 feet deep, 10 feet diameter
at the bottom, and 4 at the top.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct Bridge of Castellana.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was built in connection with an ancient
<i>Causeway</i>, which led to <i>Civita-Castellana</i>.</p>

<p>This <i>Causeway</i> was about 820 feet long and 32 feet wide;
the greatest height was about 130 feet. It was pierced in
the middle of this extent, by nine large arches; three of which
were 86 feet span, and the others were each 64 feet span.
Above these arches of the bridge the Aqueduct is built, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
height of which is about 57 feet, and it is sustained upon a
series of arches of about 19 feet span each.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Montpelier.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct is one of the most beautiful works of the
kind, which exist in France. The length is about 3,200
feet; it conducts to Montpelier the waters of <i>Saint Clement</i>
and <i>du Boulidou</i>. It was built by M. Pitot, engineer and
member of the Academy of Sciences. He was thirteen
years constructing it. This Aqueduct is formed by two
ranges of arches; those in the lower tier are seventy in
number, and each 28 feet span; the piers of these
arches are each 12 feet thick. The arches of the second
or upper tier are much smaller, and are arranged so that
three of them come within the space occupied by one of the
lower arches. They are 9 feet diameter; their piers are
4 feet and a quarter thick.</p>

<p>The greatest height of this Aqueduct is 90 feet.</p>

<p>It is constructed entirely of cut stone. The quantity of
water furnished by it is about 300,000 gallons in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Spoleto.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was constructed in the year 741, by Theodoric,
King of the Goths, to communicate with the town of
Spoleto, situated upon the summit of a mountain. It is
composed of ten grand Gothic arches each 71 feet diameter,
supported upon piers of 10½ feet thickness. The middle
arches which are over the river <i>de la Morgia</i>, are about 328
feet high.</p>

  <p class="floatc">AQUEDUCT OF SPOLETTO, ITALY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the top of this bridge is the Aqueduct which carries
the water to Spoleto.</p>

<p>This structure was difficult to execute, and being built of
a very hard stone, remains entire at the present day.</p>

<p>The total length is 800 feet, and the breadth is 44 feet.</p>

<p>The greatest height of this bridge is 420 feet.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of the Prince of Biscari.</i></h3>

<p>This Aqueduct was constructed by the Prince of Biscari,
in Sicily, at his own expense, across the river Saint-Paul,
the ancient <i>Symète</i>. It conducts a pure stream of water to
the estate of the prince, and at the same time serves as a
public bridge over the valley. This bridge is composed of
thirty-one arches, the largest of which, over the river, is 90
feet span. This arch is of Gothic form, while all the others
are semi-circular. The bridge has two tiers or ranges of
arches; the roadway is upon the first range, and the channel
for the water, upon the second or upper range. The length
of the bridge is 269 feet. The height to the top is 120 feet.
It is said that this magnificent structure was accomplished
in two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Arcueil.</i></h3>

<p>The Emperor Julian built this Aqueduct to bring water to
Paris, A. D. 360; it supplied the palace and hot baths, but
was destroyed by the Normans. It was above nine miles
and a half long, and was entirely under ground, except the
stone arcade over a deep valley at Arcueil. After its use
had been suspended 800 years, a new and beautiful arched
Aqueduct was built by the side of the ruins of the old one,
and its final restoration to public use was completed in 1634.</p>

<p>Part of this ancient construction, consisting of two arches
substantially built, still exists, near the modern Aqueduct.</p>

<p>The Aqueduct bridge over the valley of Arcueil has twenty-five
arches, is 72 feet high and 1,200 feet in length.</p>

<p>In the interior of the Aqueduct on each side is a parapet
which forms a walk. On the outside along the whole line
are various openings, called <i>regards</i>.</p>

<p>This Aqueduct was thoroughly repaired in 1777; and
fresh sums of money have lately been devoted to the same
purpose by the city of Paris. It supplies 36,000 hogsheads
daily.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Maintenon.</i></h3>

<p>This work, had it been completed, would have been one of
the most remarkable of modern times. The project was one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of the noblest examples of the enterprise which characterized
the reign of Louis XIV., and had it been carried out would
have presented a work equal in grandeur to any of the kind
constructed by the Romans. It was projected by Vauban,
and the work was commenced in 1684, but was abandoned
in 1688.</p>

<p>It was intended to conduct water from the river Eura to
Versailles; a distance of over seventy miles; and it was
also contemplated to continue the work to St. Cloud and to
Paris; had this been done it would have been over ninety
miles in length. It was intended to be of a mixed construction;
partly by a canal formed by excavations and embankments,
and partly by a channel of masonry.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable structures connected with it,
was the Aqueduct bridge across the valley of Maintenon.
This was designed to be entirely of masonry, having three
ranges of arches, one above another. The length of this
Aqueduct bridge would have been three and a quarter miles,
and the height from the lowest part of the valley would have
been 234 feet.</p>

<p>The whole number of arches designed for this bridge
was 685.</p>

<p>Some of the piers and arches of the lower tier were constructed,
but have since been suffered to crumble and fall.
Many deep valleys were filled with embankments, and the
canal was completed for a portion of the distance, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
course of the work is now but faintly marked by the remains
of these structures.</p>

<h3><i>Aqueduct of Lisbon.</i></h3>

<p>The site of Lisbon, as well as the ground in its vicinity,
consists chiefly of limestone and basalt, which render it necessary
to obtain good water, at about three leagues distance,
for the beverage, and other uses of the inhabitants. The
source consists of several springs that are near to the village
of Bellas, and their produce is conveyed to Lisbon by an
Aqueduct, constructed of a kind of white marble, and finished
in 1738. In some parts its course has been excavated
through hills; but near to Lisbon it is carried over a
deep valley, for a length of 2400 feet, by means of several
bold arches, of which the largest has a height of about 250
feet, by a breadth of 115. The arches being pointed have
an interesting aspect, particularly when viewed from below,
the interior of the spacious vaults being not only majestic in
appearance, but reverberating every sound. The water flows
through a stone tunnel, or covered arch-way, about 8 feet
wide, formed in the middle of the structure; and on each side
there is a foot-path, with a parapet wall, having a sufficient
width for two persons to walk. The Aqueduct enters the
town on its northern side, at a place called da Amoreira, where
it branches into several others, in order to supply the different
fountains, from which the inhabitants are supplied. Persons,
denominated <i>gallegos</i>, obtain a subsistence by selling the
water, which they procure at the fountains in small barrels,
and afterwards cry it through the streets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_37"><i>Aqueducts of Mexico and the adjacent States.</i></h3>

<p>The people who, in remote times, inhabited the region of
Mexico, were advanced in civilization and in the arts; they
had regularly organized states and established forms of government,
and their immense cities, their roads, Aqueducts
and other public works, give evidence of the advanced state
of the arts among them and their knowledge of the sciences.</p>

<p>The location and great population of some of their cities
required a familiar knowledge of hydraulic operations to
supply them with water; and hence it would seem as if they
had cultivated this department of the arts equally with others,
for some of their Aqueducts were of a character that would
have done honor to Greece or Rome. Nearly all the
ancient cities of Mexico were supplied by them.</p>

<p>“The city of <i>Mexico</i>, which was built on several islands
near the shore of the lake, was connected to the main land
by four great causeways or dikes, the remains of which still
exist. One of these to the south, the same by which Cortez
entered, was nearly two leagues long—another to the north
about one league, and the third at the west somewhat less.
The fourth supported the celebrated Aqueduct of Chapoltepec,
by which water was conducted from springs, upon an
insulated hill of that name, at the distance of from two to
three miles.”</p>

<p>The Aqueduct of Chapoltepec was the work of Montezuma,
and also the vast stone reservoir connected with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>This Aqueduct consisted of two conduits formed of solid
mason work—each five feet high and two paces broad—by
which the water was introduced into the city for the supply
of various fountains.</p>

<p>Olid and Alvarado commenced the siege of Mexico by attempting
to cut off this supply of water, an enterprise which
the Mexicans endeavored to prevent. “There appeared on
that side,” says De Solis, “two or three rows of pipes, made
of trees hollowed, supported by an Aqueduct of lime and
stone, and the enemy had cast up some trenches to cover
the avenue to it. But the two captains marched out of Tacuba
with most of their troops, and though they met with a
very obstinate resistance, they drove the enemy from their
post, and broke the pipes and Aqueduct in two or three
places, and the water took its natural course into the
lake.”</p>

<p>Humboldt says, there are still to be perceived the remains
of another Aqueduct, which conducted to the city the waters
of the spring of Amilco, near Churubusco. This Aqueduct,
as described by Cortez, consisted of two conduits composed
of clay tempered with mortar, about two paces in breadth,
and raised about six feet. In one of them was conveyed a
stream of excellent water, as large as the body of a man,
into the centre of the city. The other was empty, so that
when it became necessary to clean or repair the former, the
water might be turned into it; which was the case also with
those of Chapoltepec, “of which one was always in use,
whenever the other required cleaning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>The gardens of Montezuma were also adorned and
nourished with streams and <i>fountains</i>, and appear to have
rivalled those of Asiatic monarchs in splendour.</p>

<p>The ruins of the city of <i>Tezcuco</i>, which with its suburbs
was even larger than Mexico, and according to Torquemada,
contained one hundred and forty thousand houses, still betoken
an ancient place of great importance and magnificence.
Without the walls, tumuli, the sepulchres of the former inhabitants,
may yet be observed, and also the remains of a
<i>fine Aqueduct</i> in a sufficient state of preservation for present
use.</p>

<p>Two miles from <i>Tezcuco</i>, the village of <i>Huexotla</i>, situated
on the site of the ancient city of that name, which was
considered as one of the suburbs of <i>Tezcuco</i>, exhibits signs
of ancient civilization, in the foundations of large edifices,
in <i>massive Aqueducts</i>, one of which, covered with rose-colored
cement, still exists in a perfect state, and in an extensive
wall of great height and thickness. A covered way
flanked by parallel walls proceeds from the ancient city, to
the bed of a stream now dry, over which there is a remarkable
bridge, with a pointed arch 40 feet high, and supported
on one side by a pyramidal mass of masonry.</p>

<p><i>Tlascala</i> was furnished with abundance of baths and
fountains, and <i>Zempoala</i>, like the city of <i>Tezcuco</i>, had
every house supplied with water <i>by a pipe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Iztaclapa</i>, which contained about ten thousand houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
had its Aqueduct that conveyed water from the neighboring
mountains, and led it through a great number of well cultivated
gardens.</p>

<p>Among the ruins of the city of <i>Zacatecas</i>, are found the
remains of an Aqueduct; and at <i>Palenque</i> is found an
Aqueduct of stone, constructed with the greatest solidity.</p>

<p>Among the hieroglyphical ornaments of the pyramid of
<i>Xochicalco</i> are heads of crocodiles <i>spouting water</i>, and
much proof may be found that the ancient Americans were
acquainted with that property of liquids by which they find
their level; and applied it not merely to fountains and <i>jets
d’eau</i>, but to convey water through <i>pipes</i> to their dwellings.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_40"><i>Aqueducts of South America.</i></h3>

<p>The ancient inhabitants of Peru, Chili, and other parts of
South America were undoubtedly a refined, civilized and
agricultural people; they constructed extensive cities, roads,
<i>Aqueducts</i>, &amp;c. Though they constructed many and extensive
Aqueducts for the supply of towns and cities with water,
yet the object of the greater part of the public works of this
kind was for the encouragement of agriculture.</p>

<p>“The Peruvians and some of the neighboring nations
carried the cultivation of the soil to a higher stage of perfection
than any of the American nations. In consequence
of the narrow extent of land intervening between the mountains
and the sea, the rivers in this region are usually of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
small size, and the soil, being arid and sandy, needs the aid
of artificial irrigation. To such an extent did they carry
their ingenious efforts, that the sides of the steepest mountains
were converted into productive fields, by being encircled
with terraces, supported by stone walls, and watered by
<i>canals</i>.”</p>

<p>“Upon the sides of some of the mountains,” observes Mr.
Temple, “were the remains of walls built in regular stages
round them, from their base to their summits, forming terraces
on which, or between which, the Indians, in days of yore,
cultivated their crops.”</p>

<p>“Frezier says the Indians were very industrious in conveying
the waters of the rivers through their fields and to
their dwellings, and that there were still to be seen in many
places Aqueducts formed of earth and stone, and carried
along the sides of hills with great labor and ingenuity.”</p>

<p>“I have had various opportunities,” says a recent traveller,
“of closely examining one of these canals, which is formed
at the source of the river Sana, on the right bank, and extends
along a distance of fifteen leagues, without reckoning
sinuosities, and which consequently supplied a vast population;
particularly one city, whose ruins still remain in the
vicinity of a farm now called Cojal.”</p>

<p>“These Aqueducts were often of great magnitude, executed
with much skill, patience and ingenuity, and were
boldly carried along the most precipitous mountains, frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to the distance of fifteen or twenty leagues. Many
of them consisted of two conduits, a short distance apart;
the larger of these was for general use; the other and
smaller, to supply the inhabitants and water the fields, while
the first was cleansing; a circumstance in which they bear a
striking resemblance to those of Mexico.”</p>

<p>Molina, in his “Natural and Civil History of Chili,” observes,
that previous to the invasion of the Spaniards, the
natives practised artificial irrigation, by conveying water
from the higher grounds in canals to their fields. Herrera
says, many of the vales were exceedingly populous and well
cultivated, “having trenches of water.”</p>

<p>The Peruvians carried the system to a great extent.
“How must we admire, (says Humboldt,) the industry and
activity displayed by the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians in
the irrigation of arid lands!</p>

<p>“In the maritime parts of Peru, I have seen the remains of
walls, along which water was conducted for a space of from
5 to 6000 metres, from the foot of the Codilleras to the coast.
The conquerors of the 16th century destroyed these Aqueducts,
and that part of Peru has become, like Persia, a desert,
destitute of vegetation. Such is the civilization carried
by the Europeans among a people, whom they are pleased
to call barbarous.” These people had laws for the protection
of water, very similar to those of Greece, Rome, Egypt,
and all the older nations; for those who conveyed water
from the canals to their own land before their turn, were
liable to arbitrary punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>Several of the ancient American customs respecting
water, were identical with those of the oldest nations.</p>

<p>They buried vessels of water with the dead. The Mexicans
worshipped it. The Peruvians sacrificed to rivers and
fountains. The Mexicans had <i>Tlaloc</i>, their god of water.
Holy water was kept in their temples. They practised divinations
by water. The Peruvians drew their drinking water
from <i>Deep Wells</i>, and for irrigation in times of drought, they
drew it from pools, and lakes, and rivers.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that Peru, Chili, and other parts
of the southern continent, were inhabited by a refined, or
partially refined people, centuries before the time of Manco
Capac, the first Inca; and that a long period of barbarism
had intervened, induced, perhaps, by revolutions similar to
those which, in the old world, swept all the once celebrated
nations of antiquity into oblivion. The ancient Peruvians
had a tradition respecting the arrival of giants, who located
themselves on the coast, and who <i>dug</i> wells of immense
depth <i>through the solid rock</i>; which wells, as well as cisterns,
still remain.</p>

<p>There is much uncertainty respecting Manco Capac.
Who he was, and from what country he came, are equally
unknown. According to their <i>Quippus</i>, or historical cords,
and the opinion of the Inca, who was uncle to Garcilasso,
and who communicated to the latter all the knowledge of
their ancestors then extant, he made his appearance in Peru
about 400 years before the invasion of the Spaniards. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
is said he was whiter than the natives, and was clothed in
flowing garments. Awed by his presence, they received
him as a divinity, became subject to his laws, and practised
the arts he introduced. He founded Cusco, and extended
his influence to all the nations around. He taught them
agriculture and many useful arts, especially that of irrigating
land. His son succeeded him, and without violence
greatly extended the limits of the kingdom; prevailing with
the natives, it is said, by a peaceable and gentle manner,
“to plough, and manure, and cultivate the soil.” His successors
pursued the same mode, and with the same success.
The fifth Inca, we are informed, constructed Aqueducts,
bridges and roads in all the countries he subdued. When
the sixth Inca acquired a new province, he ordered the
lands to be “dressed and manured;” the fens to be drained,
“for in that art (draining) they were excellent, as is apparent
by their works, which remain to this day; and also
they were (then) very ingenious in making <i>Aqueducts</i> for
carrying water into dry and scorched lands, such as the
greatest part of that country is; they always made contrivances
and <i>inventions</i> to bring their water. These
Aqueducts, though they were ruined after the Spaniards
came in, yet several reliques and monuments of them remain
unto this day.”</p>

<p>The seventh Inca, <i>Viracocha</i>, constructed some water
works, which, in their beneficial effects, perhaps equalled
any similar undertakings in any other part of the world.
“He made an Aqueduct 12 feet in depth, and 120 leagues
in length; the source or head of it arose from certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
springs on the top of a high mountain between Parcu and
Picuy, which was so plentiful that at the very head of the
fountains they seemed to be rivers. This current of water
had its course through all the country of the Rucanas, and
served to water the pasturage of those uninhabited lands,
which are about 18 leagues in breadth, <i>watering almost the
whole country of Peru</i>.”</p>

<p>There is <i>another</i> Aqueduct much like this, which
traverses the whole province of <i>Cuntisuyu</i>, running above
150 leagues from south to north. Its head or original is
from the top of high mountains, the which waters falling
into the plains of the Quechuas, greatly refresh their pasturage,
when the heats of the summer and autumn have
dried up the moisture of the earth.</p>

<p>“There are many streams of like nature, which run
through divers parts of the empire, which being conveyed
by Aqueducts, at the charge and expense of the Incas, are
works of grandeur and ostentation, and which recommend
the magnificence of the Incas to all posterity; for these
Aqueducts may well be compared to the miraculous fabrics
which have been the works of mighty princes, who have left
their prodigious monuments of ostentation to be admired by
future ages; for, indeed, we ought to consider that these
waters had their source and beginning from vast, high
mountains, and were carried over craggy rocks and inaccessible
passages; and to make these ways plain, they had no
help of instruments forged of steel or iron, such as pickaxes
or sledges, but served themselves only with one stone to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
break another. Nor were they acquainted with the invention
of arches, to convey the water on the level from one
precipice to the other, but traced round the mountain until
they found ways and passages at the same height and level
with the head of the springs.”</p>

<p>“The cisterns or conservatories which they made for
these waters, at the top of the mountain, were about 12 feet
deep; the passage was broken through the rocks, and channels
made of hewn stone, of about two yards long and about
a yard high; which were cemented together, and rammed in
with earth so hard, that no water would pass between, to
weaken or vent itself by the holes of the channel.</p>

<p>“The current of water which passes through all the division
of Cuntisuyu I have seen in the province of Quechua, which
is part of that division, and considered it an extraordinary
work, and indeed surpassing the description and report
which hath been made of it. But the Spaniards who were
aliens and strangers, little regarded the convenience of these
works, either to serve themselves in the use of them, or to
keep them in repair, nor yet to take so much notice of them
as to mention them in their histories, but rather out of a
scornful and disdaining humor, have suffered them to run
into ruin, beyond all recovery. The same fate hath befallen
the <i>Aqueducts</i> which the Indians made for watering their
corn lands, of which two thirds at least are wholly destroyed,
and none kept in repair, unless some few which are so useful
that without them they cannot sustain themselves with bread,
nor with the necessary provisions of life. All which works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
are not so totally destroyed but that there still remain some
ruins and appearances of them.”</p>

<p>In describing the temple and gardens at Cusco. Garcilasso
observes, “there were five fountains of water, which
ran from divers places through pipes of gold. The cisterns
were some of stone, and others of gold and silver in which
they washed their sacrifices, as the solemnity of the festival
required.”</p>

<div id="toclink_47" class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Fountains"><span class="smcap">Fountains.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Artificial fountains and <i>jets d’eau</i> are of extreme antiquity;
they have been used for beautifying public grounds
of cities, and have served the purpose of moderating the
temperature of the air; in these cases the water has been in
some instances perfumed.</p>

<p>“From excavations made at Pompeii it appears that in
almost every street there was a fountain, and that bronze
statues, through which the water issued were common,—several
have been found,—four or five are boys of beautiful
workmanship; the fluid issued from vases resting on their
shoulders, or held under their arms, and in some cases from
masks. Paintings of elegant fountains, from which the
water issued in perpendicular jets, have also been discovered
both at Herculaneum and Pompeii.”</p>

<p>“In the middle of the square of the Coliseum, is a pretty
remarkable piece of antiquity, (says Blainville,) though very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
little minded by most people. Here stood anciently, a beautiful
fountain, adorned with the finest marbles and columns;
and on the top was a bronze statue of Jupiter, from which
issued great plenty of water, as may be seen on the reverse
of one of Titus’ medals. This fountain was of great use
both to the spectators and the gladiators in the amphitheatre
to refresh themselves. Pope Alexander VII. caused it to be
repaired, but since his time it has been entirely neglected.”</p>

<p>“During hot weather, Augustus the Roman Emperor
slept (observes Sentonius) with his chamber doors open,
‘and frequently in a portico with waters playing around
him.’”</p>

<p>The garden water-works of the Duke of Devonshire at
Chatsworth are probably the finest in England; being ornamented
by many fanciful devices and from a jet of six inches
diameter the water rises perpendicularly to the height of
90 feet.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fountain or <i>jet d’eau</i> in the world, is
at Cassal in Germany, where the water rises from an orifice
of 12 inches diameter to a perpendicular height of 250 feet.
The source from which it is supplied is at the top of a
mountain near by, being about 500 feet above the level of
the town. The surplus water not used for the supply of the
fountain flows down the mountain-side forming a beautiful
cascade.</p>

<p>The cities of Europe abound in fountains which in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
arrangement furnish beautiful designs and are ornamented
with specimens of workmanship displaying much skill and
refinement of taste: a minute description of them would,
however, occupy too much space, and since we have had
our attention drawn (on the subject of Aqueducts) more particularly
to the works of the Romans, we will revert to the</p>

<h3><i>Fountains of Rome.</i></h3>

<p>“If during the most distinguished eras of the Roman
state, the Aqueducts conduced to the luxurious enjoyments
of the wealthy and powerful, yet in modern times, the residents
of Rome have also found them particularly advantageous,
by their furnishing occasions for the cultivation of
those elegant arts, which, in a peculiar manner, call forth
the energies of genius, and the exercise of refined taste, in
realizing and decorating her productions. Qualities of this
kind appear conspicuous in several of the numerous fountains
which adorn that celebrated city; and the most intellectual
and accomplished professors of sculpture and architecture,
have happily united beauty and grandeur in the construction
of many such admirable edifices. These structures
are also characterized by great diversity of design, as
well as skilful execution; hence, a concise description of
several of them may be interesting.”</p>

<p>“The largest structure of this kind in Rome, is that denominated
the <i>Pauline</i> Fountain, which was built by order
of Pope Paul V., with the materials of Nerva’s Forum.
This spacious edifice is situate on the highest part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Janiculum hill, and Dominica Fontana, and Carlo Mederno,
furnished the designs for its construction. The front is
adorned with six Ionic columns of red granite, on which an
attic has a tablet containing an inscription with the pontiff’s
arms placed above it. Between the columns the spaces are
open, and from these arcades the currents of water flow with
a loud noise, and in great abundance. The apertures on the
sides are smaller than the others, and in each of those is
placed a dragon spouting water into the spacious magnificent
marble basin below. This fountain is furnished with
water by the Aqueduct called <i>Aqua Paolo</i>; and it runs
from the basin, in a very large stream into several canals,
whence it is employed to work various corn, paper, and
other mills, as well as to supply fountains and fish-ponds in
the gardens and palaces of the opulent.”</p>

<p>“Near to the baths of Dioclesian, and in the square of
the <i>Termini</i>, stands the fountain of the <i>Aqua Felice</i>. The
edifice is not only elegant but fanciful, and it has three arcades
ornamented with four Ionic columns of granite. The
middle arcade has a colossal statue of Moses, causing the
water to issue from the rock; and at the sides are two basso
relievos, one representing Aaron leading the Israelites to the
miraculous spring, and the other Gideon selecting the soldiers
to enlarge the passage for the water, which flows in
great abundance through three apertures into marble basins.
The sides are adorned by four marble lions, with the water
issuing from their mouths: two of these are formed of white
Grecian marble, and the other two of black granite. The
latter are Egyptian workmanship, and covered with hieroglyphics.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
This noble fountain was erected from a design of
Cav. Fontana; by the order of Pope Sixtus V., and its supply
of water is obtained twenty-two miles from the city.”</p>

<p>“Another of these fine structures is that called the <i>Fountain
of Trevi</i>, in which boldness of design, and elegance of
architecture are admirably united. The erection of this
very magnificent edifice commenced during the pontificate
of Clement XII., who repaired the Aqueducts. Niccolo
Salvi designed the grand front, but the work was completed
under Clement XIII., who decorated it with statues, basso
relievos in marble, and different columns of the Corinthian,
Ionic, and Composite orders. In the centre is a statue representing
Oceanus, standing in a car, drawn by two large
sea-horses, guided by Tritons. One of the horses appears
furious and impatient, whilst, on the contrary, the other is
exhibited as calm and placid, so that both are symbolical of
the tempestuous or tranquil state of the sea.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘Bounding to light, as if from ocean’s cave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The struggling sea-horse paws the lucid wave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While health and plenty smile, and Neptune’s form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Majestic sways the trident of the storm.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“A statue, designating Abundance, is placed at the right
of Oceanus, and on the left another emblematical of Health.
The basso relievo, which adorns the right side, portrays the
Emperor Trajan, contemplating a plan of the fountain; and
that on the left exhibits a girl showing to some soldiers, the
spring that supplies it with water. Various other sculptures
decorate this superb edifice; and at the top of the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
front are two figures of Fame, supporting the arms of the
Pope. Its supply of water is furnished by the Aqua Virgini,
and it flows in very large streams from three arcades.
The cost of constructing this splendid and useful fountain
was great; but it ranks among the most interesting objects
conspicuously embellishing the city of Rome.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Piazza Novana</i> has a very noble fountain standing
in its centre. It is composed of a large circular marble
basin 79 feet in diameter, in the middle of which is placed a
rock of square form with apertures at the sides. The figure
of a lion adorns one side, and that of a sea-horse another.
From the base to the top of the rock, the height is about
14 feet; and on its summit stands an Egyptian obelisk
formed of red granite, 55 feet in height, and covered with
hieroglyphics. At the four sides of the rock are colossal
marble statues, which designate the four great rivers in different
quarters of the world: viz. the Danube, the Nile, the
Ganges, and the Plata: and from these statues the water
flows in copious streams to the spacious basin below.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘The Nile and Ganges from the silver tide:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">La Plata too, and Danube’s streams unite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their liquid treasures, copious, clear and bright.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“During the summer, it is the custom occasionally to permit
the water to overflow the whole square, for the entertainment
of the people; and on midsummer’s eve persons
amuse themselves by wading and driving through the flood.
This practice has sometimes been attended with fatal accidents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and not only men but horses have actually been
drowned in the attempts to pass it in carriages.</p>

<p>“In the month of August the area of the square is likewise
filled with water for the purpose of amusement.</p>

<p>“The same square likewise contains two other fountains,
one of which consists of a capacious marble basin, having
at its centre a Triton holding a dolphin by the tail; and on
the margin of the basin are four heads with the same number
of Tritons that spout the water from their mouths. The
other fountain has not any remarkable characteristics to
entitle it to peculiar attention.”</p>

<p>“Where formerly stood the circus of Flora is now the
site of the Piazza Barberinni, which has two fountains to
embellish it:—one of them being composed of four dolphins
supporting a large open shell, with a Triton in the middle
ejecting water to a great height. The other is fanciful,
being also formed of an open shell, from which three bees
throw out the water.”</p>

<p>“In the vicinity of the Temple of Vesta stands a handsome
fountain, having a capacious basin, in which some
Tritons support a large marble shell. From the centre of
the latter, the water spouts to a considerable height, and
then descending flows over its margin into the basin beneath.
Some fine fountains adorn the magnificent colonnade in
front of the Cathedral of St. Peter. The <i>Piazza di Spagna</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
has likewise for its embellishment, a fountain in the form of
an antique boat. Besides the structures described above,
there is a great number of other fountains which evince
much diversity of taste and ingenuity in their contrivance.
But at the different villas of the opulent, the abundance of
water is rendered subservient to amusing as well as useful
purposes, and several of them are rather singular. The
description of one will convey some notion of what is
common to many of them.</p>

<p>“The delightful promenades, groves, and gardens belonging
to the Doria family, are interspersed with fountains of
various forms; besides having a beautiful lake with waterfalls.
Statues, antique basso relievos, and small fountains,
adorn a kind of amphitheatre, where a circular edifice contains
the marble figure of a fawn holding a flute, on which
it seems to play different airs: the music, however, is produced
by a machine resembling an organ in its construction,
and motion being given to it by the flowing of the water
from a cascade.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the few instances recited above will suffice to
demonstrate the different modes employed at Rome, for
calling into exercise genius, fancy, and taste, to diversify the
public edifices concerned with its abundant supply of water;
thus rendering them subservient to magnificence, entertainment,
and utility. Whilst John Dyer resided there, he
viewed these celebrated fountains with the mingled feelings
of the painter and the poet; hence, associating them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
other interesting circumstances, they furnished the materials
for one of his most striking and pathetic delineations.</p>

<span class="larger">PROGRESSIVE MEASURES FOR SUPPLYING</span><br />
<span class="small">THE</span><br />
<span class="smaller">CITY OF NEW-YORK WITH WATER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> early as 1774, when the population of the city of
New-York was only <i>twenty-two thousand</i>, the Corporation
commenced the construction of a reservoir and other works
for supplying water; and for the purpose of defraying the
expense of the undertaking, issued a paper money, amounting
to <i>two thousand five hundred pounds</i>, under the denomination
of “<i>Water Works Money</i>,” and bonds were executed
in favor of certain individuals for land and materials
to the amount of <i>eight thousand eight hundred and fifty
pounds</i> more.</p>

<p>A spacious reservoir was constructed on the east line of
Broadway, between, what is now known as Pearl and
White streets, and a well of large dimensions was sunk in
the vicinity of the Collect. The war of the revolution,
which commenced in 1775, and the consequent occupation
of the city of New-York by the British troops, was the
cause of the abandonment of the work in its unfinished state.</p>

<p>In the year 1798, Doctor Joseph Brown addressed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
communication to the Common Council, strongly recommending
the Bronx River as a source from which to obtain
a supply of good water for the use of the citizens. This
recommendation induced the Common Council to employ
William Weston, Esquire, a Civil Engineer, to examine the
subject, and he reported on the 16th of March, 1799, in
favor of the practicability of introducing the water of the
Bronx into the city. Neither of these gentlemen had used
levels or made any survey of the country over which the
water should be brought, nor was there any measurement
obtained of the flow of the stream; consequently, their
opinion was only founded on personal view, gained by
walking over the ground.</p>

<p>In April, 1799, the <i>Manhattan Company</i> was incorporated
by an act of the Legislature, and the object of this
Company was declared to be, to supply the city with pure
and wholesome water; but instead of looking for a supply
from foreign sources, they resorted to the plan of furnishing
the water from wells which they sunk within the city limits.
Besides these wells of the Manhattan Company there were
others subsequently sunk by the Corporation of the city, as
well as by individual enterprise. Some of these wells were
of great depth and capacity, having, in some instances,
horizontal excavations at a considerable depth below the
surface, branching off from the main shaft. Efforts of this
kind, however, proved unsatisfactory, and much solicitude
was felt by the citizens on account of the scarcity of <i>pure</i>
water.</p>

<p>On the 17th of March, 1822, the Mayor among other
measures suggested by him to the Common Council, brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
to their consideration, the important question of supplying
the city with pure and wholesome water, and requested its
reference to a Committee, which was accordingly done.
The Committee, of which the Mayor was one, proceeded
to the principal source of the Bronx River, in the county
of Westchester, known as the Rye Pond. They spent
two days, the 20th and 21st of March, in exploring the
country adjacent to the River and Sound, and at a meeting
of the Common Council, on the first of April, the Mayor, as
Chairman of the Committee, made a report of their observations,
and recommended an appropriation, with authority to
employ a competent engineer to survey and profile the
whole line between the city and the main source of the
river Bronx, and to ascertain the quantity of water it would
afford, and an estimate of the probable cost of completing
the project of supplying the city with good and wholesome
water from the aforesaid source. The recommendation
was concurred in, and the Mayor employed Canvas White,
Esquire, a Civil Engineer, to make the said survey and
estimate.</p>

<p>The yellow fever prevailed in the city during the summer
of 1822, and shortly after the termination of the epidemic,
on the 25th of November, the Mayor, in a communication
to the Common Council, on subjects relative to the preservation
of the public health, stated that a very important
subject connected with the health of the city, was a sufficient
supply of good water; and that on this subject all had been
done that it was practicable, under existing circumstances,
to perform; that arrangements had been made with Mr.
White, a Civil Engineer of repute, to examine the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
sources from which a supply was likely to be obtained, and
to furnish correct surveys and profiles of the heights and
depressions of the country through which the water must be
conveyed, and that he had been requested to report as soon
as it was practicable.</p>

<p>In 1823, the Sharon Canal Company was chartered by
the State, and among its duties was that of supplying the
city of New-York with pure and wholesome water. The
work was not, however, undertaken.</p>

<p>In January, 1824, Mr. White made his report, which he
prefaced as follows:—“That he had the honor of receiving
a request from Stephen Allen, late Mayor, to make an
examination and estimate of the expense of furnishing the
city with a copious supply of good and wholesome water.
Agreeably to that request, I have made the necessary
surveys, levels and examinations to ascertain the practicability
of the project,” &amp;c. &amp;c. At the same date, Benjamin
Wright, Esq., reported to the Common Council on the
same subject, which he prefaces as follows:—“In obedience
to a request of your honorable body, communicated to me
by Stephen Allen, Esq., late Mayor, in November last, desiring
me to assist Canvas White, Esq., with my advice and
counsel, as to the best method of supplying the city of
New-York with plenty of good water, I beg leave to make
the following report,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. White reported in favor of bringing the water of the
Bronx to the city; taking it from the River at the Westchester
Cotton Factory pond. The natural flow of the
River at this place, he stated to be 3,000,000 of gallons per
day, in the driest season, and he proposed by artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
works at the upper Rye pond, and by lowering the outlet of
this pond, to obtain 3,600,000 gallons more per day; thus
furnishing a daily supply of 6,600,000 gallons. The cost of
bringing the water to a reservoir near the Park, was estimated
at $1,949,542. Mr. Wright concurred with him in
this opinion.</p>

<p>In 1825 a company was incorporated by the Legislature,
and called the “<i>New-York Water Works Company</i>,” with
authority to supply the city with pure water. Canvas White,
Esq., was appointed Engineer to this Company, and in his
report to the Directors, he recommended taking the waters
of the Bronx at Underhill’s bridge; estimated that 9,100,000
gallons of water could be delivered in the city daily, and
that the expense would not exceed $1,450,000.</p>

<p>The charter of this company proved so defective in practice,
that they were unable to proceed under it, and they
accordingly applied to the Legislature in 1826 for an
amendment, authorizing the company to take such of the
waters, land and materials, by appraisement of indifferent
persons, as might be required for the work. In this application,
however, they were defeated, by the opposition of
the Sharon Canal Company, who claimed, under their
charter, all the water on the route of their canal. The
Water Works Company was accordingly dissolved in 1827.</p>

<p>In 1831, the Common Council of the city, impelled by a
sense of the importance of a supply of pure and wholesome
water, began to take more decided steps towards the accomplishment
of the object: a Committee of the Board of
Aldermen on Fire and Water, consisting of James Palmer,
Samuel Stevens and William Scott, to whom were referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
various communications and resolutions on the subject of
supplying the city with water, presented a report adducing
facts and arguments sufficient to prove the practicability of
the project and the ability of the Corporation to meet the
expense; and prefaced that report as follows:—“That they
approach the subject as one of vast magnitude and importance
to an already numerous and dense population, requiring
our municipal authorities no longer to satisfy themselves
with speeches, reports and surveys, but actually to
raise the <i>means</i> and strike the spade into the ground, as a
commencement of this all important undertaking.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Their attention was drawn, at that time, to the Bronx
River, with the ponds at its head, as the source for supply;
but appended to their report is a letter directed to the
Corporation and signed Cyrus Swan, “who is President of
the New-York and Sharon Canal Company,” in which it is
asserted, “it has been ascertained that <i>that</i> River (the
Croton) can be carried into the city of New-York, and
that without it, a supply which shall be adequate to the
present and future wants of the city cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>This Committee drafted an <i>Act</i> for the Legislature to
pass, which was approved by the Common Council, and
presented to the Legislature in the session of 1832, but
failed in becoming a law. That <i>Act</i> provided for the
appointment of a Board of Commissioners of three persons,
by the Common Council, to superintend the execution of
the plan and make contracts for introducing water into
the city of New-York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>In November, 1832, a report was made by Timothy
Dewey and William Serrell to Benjamin Wright, Esq.
They had examined the sources of the Bronx River and
other streams, and the practicability of introducing the water
of the Croton by connecting it with the Sawmill and Bronx
Rivers;—they did not consider it possible to bring the Croton
water to mingle with those of the aforesaid rivers without
the aid of expensive machinery, from the great height it
would be necessary to elevate the water. They finally
recommended the Bronx as a sufficient source, with some
artificial reservoirs, to answer all the city purposes.</p>

<p>The frightful ravages of the cholera, during the summer
of 1832, gave to the subject of <i>a supply of pure water</i> a
deeper interest, and the minds of the citizens were again
aroused to the importance of it. The Committee of the
Board of Aldermen, on “Fire and Water,” James Palmer,
chairman, pursued the subject with energy; exhibiting on
all occasions perseverance and industry in their researches.</p>

<p>Myndert Van Schaick, Esq., being a member of the Board
of Aldermen at that time, was familiar with the question of
a supply of pure and wholesome water, and holding the
situation of Treasurer of the Board of Health, became
deeply interested in the measure, and urged it as a matter
of the deepest importance to the permanence, welfare and
financial interests of the city, that every method should be
taken to investigate and probe the subject which cautious
men could adopt, and his efforts in the subsequent measures
and provisions of law in relation to it are of the same
character.</p>

<p>In December, 1832, De Witt Clinton, Esq., of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
States Corps of Engineers, made a report pursuant to a
request of the Committee on Fire and Water, in which,
after stating the substance of the several reports in favor of
the Bronx as the source of supply, he arrives at the conclusion,
that an adequate supply can only be obtained from the
Croton River.</p>

<p>He proposed to take the waters of the Croton at Pine’s
bridge, which he stated to be 183 feet above the level of the
Hudson; to conduct the water in an open Aqueduct, following
the line of the Croton and Hudson Rivers, and cross
Harlem River on an arch of 138 feet in height, and 1,000
feet in length. The whole cost he estimated at $2,500,000.</p>

<p>It does not appear, however, that any levels were run, or
survey made by Mr. Clinton, of the route he recommended;
but, that he depended on the information of others, together
with his personal observation, for the subject matter of his
report.</p>

<p>In a report made to the Board of Aldermen in January,
1833, it was suggested that the failure of the law asked for
the year previous, was in consequence of a want of sufficient
information to warrant the opinion of the feasibility of
the project, and it recommended that immediate application
should be made to the Legislature, asking for the appointment
of a Board of Commissioners, with full powers to
examine all the plans proposed, to cause surveys, and to
estimate the probable expense of supplying the city of
New-York with water.</p>

<p>The Committee recommended that the Commissioners
should be appointed by the Governor and Senate, and that
their number should consist of five, “inasmuch as the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
of their appointment is to settle conclusively the plan to be
adopted, and the amount requisite for its performance.”
This report was concurred in by the Board of Assistants,
and approved of by the Mayor, January 17th, 1833.</p>

<p>In compliance with the request of the Common Council
the Legislature of the State, on the 26th of February, 1833,
passed an Act,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> providing for the appointment by the Governor
and Senate, of five persons, as Water Commissioners,
whose duty it was by said Act declared to be “to examine
and consider all matters relative to supplying the city of
New-York with a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome
water for the use of its inhabitants, and the amount of money
necessary to effect that object.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this law, the Governor and Senate appointed
the Board of Water Commissioners, consisting of the
following named gentlemen:—Stephen Allen, William W.
Fox, Saul Alley, Charles Dusenberry and Benjamin M.
Brown. They were directed to make their report to the
Legislature, by the second Monday of January, 1834, and
to present a <i>copy</i> thereof to the Common Council of the
City of New-York on or before the first day of November,
1833.</p>

<p>The Commissioners proceeded in the discharge of their
duties, employed as Engineers Canvas White, Esquire, and
Major D. B. Douglass, of the United States Corps of Engineers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and made all necessary examinations so as to
determine, whether a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome
water could be obtained for present and future purposes,
whether its introduction into the city would be
practicable at an elevation precluding the use of machinery,
and also what would be the probable cost of completing the
projected work. Their report satisfied the Legislature that
a supply of pure and wholesome water was of great
importance to the city—that its introduction was feasible,
and that the expense was within the financial ability of the
citizens. Accordingly an Act<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> was passed by the Legislature,
on the 2d of May, 1834, which provided for the appointment
of five Water Commissioners by the Governor and
Senate, and they were required “to examine and consider
all matters relative to supplying the city of New-York with
a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome water; to adopt
such plan as in their opinion will be most advantageous for
securing such supply, and to report a full statement and
description of the plan adopted by them; to ascertain, as
near as may be, what amount of money may be necessary
to carry the same into effect; to report an estimate of the
probable amount of revenue that will accrue to the city,
upon the completion of the work, and the reasons and
calculations upon which their opinion and estimates may be
founded; such report to be made and presented to the
Common Council of the city on or before the first day of
January, 1836.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>It was further provided, that “in case the plan adopted by
the Commissioners shall be approved by the Common Council,
they shall submit it to the electors to express their assent
or refusal to allow the Common Council, to instruct the
Commissioners to proceed in the work.”</p>

<p>The Commissioners who were appointed in 1833, were
re-appointed under the Act of the 2d of May, 1834. They
immediately entered upon the duties of their office, thoroughly
re-examined their former work, and decided that the Croton
River was the only source that would furnish an adequate
supply of water for present and future purposes. In making
these examinations they employed, as Engineers, David B.
Douglass, John Martineau and George W. Cartwright,
Esquires. Various plans were proposed for conveying the
water to the city, and estimates made of the cost of the work
constructed by either of these plans, but the one recommended
by the Commissioners, and that for which a preference
was expressed by the Engineers, Messrs. Martineau
and Douglass, was a closed Aqueduct of masonry. These
gentlemen each made an estimate of the cost of bringing
the water of the Croton River to the city of New-York by
a closed Aqueduct of masonry, and the Water Commissioners
offered, as the true cost of the work, an average of the
two estimates. The cost of the work, as estimated for this
plan and presented by the Water Commissioners, (including
the cost of the city mains and conduits,) was $5,412,336.72.</p>

<p>The report of the Water Commissioners was referred to
a Committee, who reported to the Common Council, on the
4th of March, 1835, two resolutions, the first approving the
plan adopted by the Commissioners as described in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
report; and the second referring the subject to the electors
at the ensuing annual election, as required by the Act of
May 2d, 1834. These resolutions were adopted by the
Common Council, and at the election in April, 1835, the
subject having been duly submitted to the electors of the
city and county of New-York, a majority of the voters were
found to be in favor of the measure. On the 7th of May
following, the Common Council “instructed the Commissioners
to proceed with the work.”</p>

<p>Thus authorized, the Commissioners immediately commenced
the preparatory measures for the construction of the
work. David B. Douglass was employed as Chief Engineer;
he proceeded in the location of the line for the Aqueduct
and in preparing plans, until October, 1836, when he was
succeeded by John B. Jervis, who continued at the head of
that department during the construction of the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>The construction of the work was commenced in May
1837; and on the 22d June, 1842, the Aqueduct received
the water from the Fountain Reservoir on the Croton:—on
the 27th of June, the water having been permitted to traverse
the entire length of the Aqueduct, entered the Receiving
Reservoir at the city of New-York, and was admitted into
the Distributing Reservoir on the 4th of July.</p>

<p>The Commissioners who were appointed in 1833, and re-appointed
in 1834, continued in the performance of their
duties until 1837—in March, of which year Thomas T.
Woodruff was appointed in the place of Benjamin M. Brown,
who resigned his office, and the Board of Commissioners
thus constituted, continued until March, 1840, when they
were succeeded by Samuel Stevens, John D. Ward, Zebedee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Ring, Benjamin Birdsall and Samuel R. Childs. This
Board of Commissioners remained in office until February,
1843, when they were succeeded by the gentlemen who
composed the former Board.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="OF_PLANS_PROPOSED_FOR_FURNISHING_THE_CITY_WITH">OF PLANS PROPOSED FOR FURNISHING THE CITY WITH
WATER, AND OF THE PLAN ADOPTED.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the course of examinations which were made to determine
sources whence water could be obtained, questions of
deep importance presented themselves in regard to the
source to be relied upon for a supply, also in reference to
the plan which should be adopted for conducting the water
to the city.</p>

<p>It was of so much importance to the city that the supply
should be such as not only to answer the present purposes,
but be adequate to the future increased demands, and that
the quality of the water should be unquestionable, that it
became necessary to extend the examinations over every
watered district in the vicinity, in order to judge of the
comparative merits of different sources. The Engineers
who were employed, traversed the country, gauged the
streams, reported their supply, the quality of the water, and
plans which might be adopted for conveying it to the city.
It was a field for the exercise of the talent and research of
the Engineer: in resorting to a distant stream for a supply,
any plan which he might propose for conveying the water,
would encounter obstacles requiring skill and ingenuity to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
overcome. He would find it necessary to build up the valleys,
pierce through the hills, and span the waters of the
arms of the sea which embrace the city and make it an
island. Structures would be required, which, in their design,
would find no parallel among the public works of this
country, and in forming plans for them he might study with
advantage, the works constructed for similar purposes by
the Ancient Romans.</p>

<p>The examinations embraced all the sources from which a
supply of water might be obtained in the neighboring counties
of Westchester and Putnam; giving a comparison of
the different streams in regard to their elevation, their capacity,
and the quality of the water. It was decided that the
Croton River would supply a sufficient quantity of water at
all seasons of the year; at an elevation precluding the use
of steam or any other extraneous power, and that the quality
of the water was unexceptionable. Other streams were
found which would furnish water equally pure, but too
limited in quantity at certain seasons of the year, and not at
a sufficient elevation.</p>

<p>In addition to the information furnished by the Engineers
employed, the Water Commissioners received communications
from other sources suggesting plans for supplying the
city with water.</p>

<p>It was suggested that water might be obtained from the
Passaic Falls, at a distance of about eighteen miles from
the city, in New-Jersey. The objections to this project
were, that it would be going into another state, that an
Aqueduct bridge over the Hudson River would obstruct
its navigation, and iron pipes laid across the bed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
river would be exposed to injury from the anchors of the
shipping. Another plan was proposed which contemplated
a permanent dam across the Hudson River extending from
the city to the Jersey shore. This dam was proposed to
be built about 2 feet above the level of high tide, thereby
keeping all the salt water below; and above the dam would
be the fresh water for supplying the city, which must be
pumped up into a reservoir by means of water-wheels, which
would be operated by the overfall of water when the tide
was low, but when the tide was up within 2 feet of the top
of the dam there would not be sufficient fall to propel the
wheels. Locks were to be inserted in the dam, of a sufficient
number to accommodate the vessels on the river. The
river, at the place where it was proposed to locate the dam,
is over a mile in width, and in the channel the depth below
the surface to proper foundation for such a structure, would
probably be 50 feet. The difference of tides is about 5 feet,
which added to the height of dam above high tides, would
give 7 feet of the top of the dam exposed to the pressure
of the water on the up stream side when the tide is low.</p>

<p>It was suggested that the hydraulic power here obtained,
could be used for manufacturing purposes, except that portion
of it which would be required for elevating the water to
the reservoir. This plan of supplying the city with water
was objected to, because it could not be accomplished except
by an Act of the Legislature of New-Jersey as well as
that of New-York, and it was also questionable whether such
obstructions could be placed in navigable rivers without interfering
with the powers of Congress to regulate the commerce
of the nation. It was feared that in locking vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
through, the salt water would become mingled with the fresh
above the dam where a supply would be taken for the city,
to such a degree, that it would render it unfit for domestic
use. The quantity of land that would be overflowed by the
water set back by the dam, presented another objection.
The space of time that the tide would be sufficiently low to
allow the wheels to work in pumping water into the reservoir,
would be entirely too short to insure a supply. This
objection was offered by Frederick Graff, Esq., the superintendent
of the Philadelphia Water Works, who stated that
although the dam on the Schuylkill River is raised 6 feet 6
inches above the highest tides, the delay in pumping, occasioned
by the tides, averages seven hours out of the twenty-four;
and in full moon tides, from eight to nine hours.</p>

<p>The projector of this plan set forth many advantages
which he thought would arise from the construction of the
dam, but the obstruction to the navigation of the river, the
destruction of the shad fishery, and various objections besides
those already mentioned, induced the Water Commissioners
to reject the idea of building a dam across the
Hudson.</p>

<p>We have now gone over most of the preliminary steps
which were taken before deciding upon the source for a
supply of water.—Having fixed upon the Croton River as
a stream possessing the requisite advantages for a supply,
questions naturally arose as to the manner in which it should
be conveyed to the city. The distance being about forty
miles, over a country extremely broken and uneven, and
following a direction, for a portion of this distance, parallel
with the Hudson River, encountering the streams which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
empty into it and form deep valleys in their courses. It will
be interesting to notice the different plans which were
suggested for forming a channel-way to conduct the water.
The following modes were presented:—a plain channel
formed of earth, like the ordinary construction of a canal
feeder:—an open channel, protected against the action of the
current by masonry:—an arched culvert or conduit, composed
essentially of masonry; and iron pipes. In deciding
which of these modes should be adopted, it was necessary
to make a comparison among them as to their efficiency
for conducting the water in purity, and in the quantity
required, their permanency as structures, and their cost.</p>

<p>The disadvantages attendant upon an open canal were,
that by filtration through the banks there would be a heavy
loss of water;—the difficulty of preserving the water from
receiving the wash of the country, and preventing injurious
matter from being thrown into it and rendering it impure,
and the impurities which might be contracted by passing
through different earths. Evaporation would also occasion
a serious loss of water. The banks would be liable to failure
in seasons of long-continued rains, and the city depending
upon this for a supply, would be cut off, except there should
be sufficient in the reservoirs to furnish a supply during the
period of repairs. The canal could never be subjected to a
<i>thorough</i> repair, because of the necessity of keeping it in a
condition for furnishing water constantly during the whole
year, so that all repairs would be done under great disadvantages,
and the channel would be yearly growing worse
until its failure might become a public calamity. In regard to
the open channel having the sides protected by masonry, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
objections were found to be such as would apply equally to
every species of open channel; namely, that it would be
exposed in many situations to receive the wash of the country;
that it would be unprotected from the frost, and liable
to be interrupted thereby, and lastly, that there would be a
loss by evaporation. It was supposed that these objections
might be obviated by certain precautions; for example, the
wash could be avoided by making sufficient side drains; and
the interruption liable to occur from frost and snow, and the
evaporation, to a certain extent, could be prevented by
closing the channel entirely with a roof over the top. The
close channel or culvert, composed essentially of masonry
seemed to possess all the requisite advantages for conducting
the water in a pure state and keeping it beyond the
influence of frost or any interruption which would be liable
to occur to an open channel. In point of stability this plan
had a decided preference over either of the other plans
proposed, and the only objection offered was the cost of the
work constructed in this way. To avoid too great expense
it was proposed to make use of a mixed construction, using
the close channel or culvert in situations where deep excavations
occurred and it would be desirable to fill in the earth
again to the natural form, also where the line of Aqueduct
intersected villages, and using the open channel with slope
walls for the residue of the distance.</p>

<p>In regard to iron pipes for conducting the water, it was
found that a sufficient number of them to give the same
sectional area as would be adopted by either of the other
plans would be more expensive, and considering the great
distance and the undulating surface over which they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
extend, other disadvantages were presented which added to
the objections, and the plan was considered inexpedient.
Could a line be graded so as to give a regular inclination
from the Fountain Reservoir to one at the city, then the expense
of laying iron pipes for conducting the proposed
quantity of water, would be greater than for constructing a
channel-way of masonry; and when laid, the pipes were
thought to be less durable. Should the pipes follow the
natural undulations of the ground, there would be so much
resistance offered to the flow of water that the discharge
would be diminished in a very great degree.</p>

<p>The close channel or conduit of masonry was adopted as
the plan best calculated to answer all the purposes of conducting
the water to the city.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_75"><i>Sources of the Croton River.</i></h3>

<p>The sources of the Croton River are principally in the
county of Putnam, at a distance of fifty miles from the city
of New-York; they are mostly springs which in that elevated
and uneven country have formed many ponds and lakes
never-failing in their supply. There are about twenty of
these lakes which constitute the sources of the Croton River,
and the aggregate of their surface areas is about three
thousand eight hundred acres.</p>

<p>From these sources to the mouth of the Croton at the
head of Tappan Bay in the Hudson, the distance is about
twenty-five miles. The country bordering upon the Croton
is generally elevated and uneven, not sustaining a dense
population and cleared sufficiently to prevent injury to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
water from decayed vegetable matter. The river has a
rapid descent and flows over a bed of gravel and masses of
broken rock. From these advantages there is good reason
to suppose that the water will receive very little impurity
from the wash of the country through which it flows, and
there is no doubt that the sources furnish that which is
peculiarly adapted to all the purposes of a large city.</p>

<p>The water is of such uncommon purity that in earlier
days the native Indian gave a name to the river which signified
“<i>clear water</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_76"><i>Flow of Water in the Croton River, Capacity of the
Fountain Reservoir, &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p>The medium flow of water in the Croton, where the fountain
reservoir is formed, exceeds fifty millions of gallons in
twenty-four hours, and the minimum flow, after a long-continued
drought, is about twenty-seven millions of gallons in
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The dam on the Croton River is about 38 feet above
the level which was the surface of the natural flow of
water at that place, and sets the water back about six
miles, forming the Fountain Reservoir which covers an
area of about four hundred acres. The country forming
the valley of the River was such as to give bold shores to
this reservoir generally, and in cases where there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
gentle slope or a level of the ground near the surface of
water, excavations were made so that the water should not
be of less depth than four and a half feet.</p>

<p>The great length of this Reservoir is favourable for the
purity of the water which enters the Aqueduct: spread
over this large surface, it will have an opportunity to settle
and part with some of the impurities which it receives,
during rainy seasons, from the wash of the country through
which it flows.</p>

<p>The available capacity of this Reservoir, down to the level
where the water would cease to flow off in the Aqueduct,
has been estimated at six hundred millions of gallons.</p>

<p>Could we suppose that the Croton River will ever in any
season of drought, fail to furnish a supply greater than
would be carried off from this Reservoir and the Reservoirs
at the city by evaporation, we have still a supply of water
which would be sufficient for one million of inhabitants
during the space of thirty days (estimating the amount
necessary for each inhabitant to be twenty gallons for every
twenty-four hours.)</p>

<p>But we may assume the number of inhabitants at present
to be one third of a million, and therefore we have a sufficient
store of water in this Fountain Reservoir to supply
them for the space of ninety days, in the emergency before
supposed. In addition to the quantity in the Fountain Reservoir,
we have sufficient in the Reservoirs at the city to
supply one third of a million of inhabitants for about twenty-five
days, at the rate of supply before mentioned. Thus we
find, should such a limit as we have supposed ever happen
to the supply from the River, the season of drought cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
certainly be supposed to continue during the length of time
(about four months) that would be required for the present
population of the city to exhaust the quantity in store when
all the Reservoirs are full.</p>

<p>The minimum flow of water in the river where the dam is
constructed, has been stated to be twenty-seven millions of
gallons for every twenty-four hours. This would be a sufficient
supply for one million of inhabitants, and should the
population of the city increase to one million and a half, this
supply, together with the quantity in store, will probably be
sufficient during any season of drought. There is, therefore,
no fear in regard to the supply for the present, and should
the time arrive when the city will require more than the
present facilities afford during low stages of the river, other
streams may be found which can be turned into the upper
branches of the Croton, or into the Aqueduct along its
course. Other Reservoirs may also be constructed farther
up the Croton to draw from in seasons of drought. These
suggestions would only be useful to provide a supply during
the low stages of the river, for at other seasons the flow of
water in the Croton would be equal to the full capacity of
the Aqueduct.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<h3 id="toclink_78"><i>General Design of the Channel-way and Reservoirs.</i></h3>

<p>A description of the general design and purpose of the
channel-way in connection with the Reservoirs will serve to
give a clear understanding of the operation of the work.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Having ascertained the elevation in the city at which it
would be desirable to use the water, it was only necessary
then, to find a point on the Croton River where a dam could
be constructed that would turn the water into a channel
having a gradual descent to the required elevation at the
city. So that it may easily be conceived, it is only diverting
the water into another channel where it will flow on unobstructed.
The manner in which water is conducted from its
natural channel, for the purpose of propelling the machinery
of manufacturing establishments, by a race-way or other
channel, is a simple illustration of the operation of this great
work.</p>

<p>At the place where it was determined to build the dam
across the Croton River, the surface of the natural flow of
water was about 38 feet below the elevation required as a
head for the water to flow into the Aqueduct leading to the
city. By going farther up the river the dam would have
been of less height, and a point might have been found where
it would be only necessary to build a dam to turn the water,
and not form a pond of much extent above it, but for such
purpose it would have been necessary to go above where
some important tributaries enter the river, and would have
required a considerable extension of the Aqueduct. It was
perhaps desirable to form this Fountain Reservoir, so that it
would afford a supply of water to draw from, should there
at any future time, in a season of drought, be more required
for the use of the city than would be flowing in the river.</p>

<p>No essential change occurs in the form of the channel-way
from the Fountain Reservoir on the Croton, to the Receiving
Reservoir on the island of New-York; a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of thirty-eight miles, except in crossing Harlem River to
reach the island, and in passing a deep valley on the island,
where iron pipes are used instead of the channel-way of
masonry to provide for the pressure consequent upon a depression
from the regular plane.</p>

<p>At these points the iron pipes descend and rise again, so
that when the water is flowing in the channel-way they will
be constantly full. Thus it will be perceived that the channel-way
of masonry will never be filled entirely, so as to
occasion a pressure on all its interior surface.</p>

<p>The surface of the Fountain Reservoir is 166⅙ feet above
the level of mean tide at the city of New-York; and the
difference of level between that and the surface of the Receiving
Reservoir on the island of New-York, (a distance of
thirty-eight miles) is 47⅙ feet, leaving the surface of this reservoir
119 feet above the level of mean tide. From the
Receiving Reservoir the water is conducted (a distance of
two miles) in iron pipes to the Distributing Reservoir, where
the surface of the water is 115 feet above the level of mean
tide. This last is the height to which the water may generally
be made available in the city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="GENERAL_CONSTRUCTION_OF_THE_AQUEDUCT">GENERAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE AQUEDUCT.</h2>
</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>. is a section of the Aqueduct showing the form of
the masonry used in earth excavations. The foundation is
formed with concrete; the side walls of stone; the bottom
and sides of the interior being faced with brick, and the top
covered with an arch of brick.</p>

<p>In forming the concrete a mortar is made by mixing three
parts of sand with one of hydraulic lime, and then mixing
about three parts of stone, broken to a size allowing them to
pass through a ring an inch and a half in diameter. Having
thoroughly mingled the broken stone and mortar, the concrete
is placed in its proper position and form, and brought
into a compact state by using a <i>pounder</i>; and is then suffered
to remain until it set, or become indurated, before any
work is commenced upon it. The object should be to mix
as many stones or pebbles as will thoroughly bed in the
mortar, allowing none of them to come in contact, but all to
be enveloped in mortar. This forms a body which becomes
indurated and makes a foundation under the whole length of
the Aqueduct like one continuous stone. It attains a degree
of hardness which gives it the appearance of the conglomerate
bearing the name of <i>Pudding-stone</i>, and is an article of
the greatest importance in forming foundations for walls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
great weight; superseding in many instances, where the soil
is soft, the use of piles or other timber foundation.</p>

<p>Though we have evidence that concrete was used by the
Ancient Romans in the foundations of some of their structures
and even in the formation of their roads—such as the
Appian-Way, and though we find it used in the foundations
of the feudal castles of the Norman Barons of England, still
it has not been introduced into the general practice of architecture
until quite a modern date, and even at the present time
is not widely appreciated in this country as a material of so
much importance in foundations.</p>

<p>The side walls are laid up in a character of workmanship
styled “<i>rough-hammered work</i>;” the stone required to be of
sound and durable quality and laid in a manner to render
the work water-tight. Though attention is given in some
degree to insure a proper bond to the wall, yet the point
more particularly attended to, is to make it compact and
impervious to water. The bonding of the wall is not by
any means disregarded, in all situations where it is required,
yet the position of the work generally, where it is in excavation
below the natural surface of the ground, renders such
precaution of less importance than that of making it compact.
The mortar used in these side walls is formed by
mixing clean sharp sand with hydraulic lime, using the proportions
of three parts of the sand to one of the lime; and
these are thoroughly mixed and incorporated before they
are wet; when this mixture is wet and thoroughly worked,
it is used immediately and always kept properly tempered
so as to render it plastic, and to prevent any disposition to
become hardened before it is in the wall. After the side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
walls are finished and the concrete between them has received
its proper form, a coating of plastering, about three
eighths of an inch in thickness, is put on over the surface of
the concrete and on the face of the walls before the interior
facing of brick is commenced. The proportions of this
plastering are two parts of sand to one of the hydraulic lime.</p>

<p>The bricks used in this work are generally of quite a
different character from those used in ordinary house-building;
being harder burnt and of a superior quality of material.
They are required to be burnt to such a degree of
hardness that they present a cherry red, or brownish color,
and give a clear ringing sound when struck; and when
broken, must present a compact and uniform texture. All
bricks brought upon the work which are soft and of a pale
color, such as are usually denominated <i>salmon brick</i>, are
rejected. Those which are used, possess nearly the hardness
and durability of ordinary building stone, and are
calculated to resist the action of the water, to which they
will be exposed.</p>

<p>The advantage of using brick is, that a smooth channel
offering little resistance to the flow of water can be formed
with less expense than with stone, and greater security can
be obtained against any leakage; for besides the coat of
plastering which covers the face of the walls and the top of
the concrete, there is also a mortar joint between this plastering
and the brick work. The bricks being of good form
and easily handled, can be more expeditiously and closely
laid than the face of a wall of stone, and afford a smooth and
uniform face to the wall with less expense. They are required
to be bedded full and flush with mortar, so that on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
lifting one from its position in the work, no imperfections be
discovered, but the impress of the brick be found distinct
throughout.</p>

<p>The proportions of the mortar for the brick work, are two
parts of sand to one of hydraulic lime.</p>

<p>The inverted arch of brick, as well as the brick facing on
the sides, is four inches thick, and the roofing arch of brick
is eight inches thick.</p>

<p>After the masonry is finished the excavation which was
done to receive it, is filled up around it, and over the top of
the roofing arch generally to the height of 3 to 4 feet, and
in some instances of deep excavation, up to the natural surface.
If the natural surface be not of sufficient height for
the top of the earth covering, the earth is raised to the requisite
height with proper width on the top and slopes on
the sides for protection to the Aqueduct masonry.</p>

<p class="clear p2"><a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>. is a section of the Aqueduct in open cutting in
rock.</p>

<p>After the rock has been excavated to the required depth
and width, the bottom is levelled up with concrete to the proper
height and form for the inverted arch of brick, which is
laid in the manner before described for earth excavation.
The side walls of stone and brick are bonded together by
headers of brick entering the stone walls as shown in the
drawing, and the walls of stone are built closely against the
sides of the rock and forming a junction with it. On the
exterior of the roofing arch a heavy spandrel of stone masonry
(of the same character as the stone walls beneath it)
is built, filling the space between the arch and the rock.
After the masonry is finished, the rock cut above it is filled
with earth to the same height above the roofing arch as
mentioned for earth excavation.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>. is a section of the Aqueduct in tunnel cutting
in rock.</p>

<p>The width of the tunnel excavation in rock is the same as
that of open excavation in rock; and the manner of building
the masonry to form the channel-way is the same, with
the exception that the rock roof of the tunnel serves as the
roof of the channel-way, where it is sound, but in cases
where the rock is soft and liable to fall, a brick arch is built
over the channel-way, and the space between its extrados,
or outer surface, and the rock roof is filled with earth closely
rammed in. In some instances where the tunnel perforated
rock which was at first quite hard, the roofing has by exposure
to the air, become soft and insecure, so as to render it
necessary to turn an arch for its support. This is attended
with inconvenience and some difficulty after the channel-way
has been completed and closed through the tunnel.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>. is a section of the Aqueduct in tunnel cutting in
earth.</p>

<p>When the earth is dry and compact, the excavation for
the bottom and sides is made of a proper form to receive
the masonry, which is built closely against it: the top is excavated
sufficiently high to give room to turn the arch, and
the space above is afterwards filled with earth closely rammed
in. Where the earth is wet and there is difficulty in
making it stand, the excavation is made larger, and props of
timber and plank are used to support the top and sides until
the masonry be completed; and the whole space exterior to
the masonry is then compactly filled with earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p><a href="#Plate_V">Plate V</a>. is a section of the Aqueduct showing the manner
of constructing it across valleys, or where the natural
surface of the ground falls below the plane of grade.</p>

<p>In such cases the Aqueduct is supported upon a foundation
wall of stone laid dry, and formed by using large stones
laid in positions to give proper bond, and to allow small
broken stone to be closely packed in, filling up all the
interstices so as to form a compact and uniform mass.
The wall is generally allowed to stand some months after
it is completed, before the masonry of the Aqueduct is
commenced upon it, lest by this weight being placed upon it
before it has found its bearing, it should settle and cause
cracks in the masonry. That such settlement should in some
instances occur, even after the Aqueduct is completed, is
not surprising, for passing over so many different elevations,
and encountering such numerous transitions from a hard
soil, or from rock, to valleys of alluvial deposit, it would be
beyond human powers of foresight and vigilance to prevent
it.</p>

<div id="i_86a" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 54em;">
  <div id="Plate_V" class="caption top"><p>V</p></div>
  <img src="images/i_086a.jpg" width="1713" height="1078" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">
  <p class="floatl"><i>F. B. Tower.</i></p><p class="floatr"><i>Gimber.</i></p>
</div></div>

<p>To render the Aqueduct more secure in such positions,
the concrete foundation has an increased thickness, and in
preparing it a greater proportion of hydraulic lime is used;
the proportion being two and a half parts of sand to one of
lime. The dimensions of the stone side walls and the spandrel
backing of the roofing arch, are also increased; and
the proportion of hydraulic lime to the sand in the mortar
for these is increased. Another precaution has been taken
to render the work secure, by plastering the interior of the
Aqueduct over these foundation walls. The embankment
adjacent to foundation walls has various slopes according to
circumstances, and is generally protected with a dry stone
wall on the face, and is carried up of sufficient width to
insure the requisite covering over the Aqueduct masonry.</p>

<p>Along side hills an excavation is made for the Aqueduct
into the hill, and a protection wall of stone built on the lower
side so as to support a covering of earth over the masonry;
great care being taken to obtain a deep and firm footing for
this wall in order to render the work secure. In such a position
the Aqueduct is perhaps less secure than in those before
described. Where the soil is wet from springs, and the
formation clay, there is danger of slides; and in rainy seasons
there is danger from the torrents which gather on the
hill sides and come down with destructive force: the earth
covering is liable to be carried away, and the Aqueduct itself
to be undermined. Great care has, however, been used in
such cases to form strong paved channels for the passage of
the water over the top of the Aqueduct, or by culverts to
pass it underneath.</p>

<h3>WASTE-WEIRS.</h3>

<p>At suitable places on the line of the Aqueduct, waste-weirs
are constructed to discharge surplus water. They are constructed
in one side of the channel-way, in such manner as
to allow the water to flow off when it rises above a given
level, and arrangements are also made at these places to
close the channel-way entirely, by means of stop planks, and
to discharge the whole of the water through waste-gates;
so that the water might be running from the Fountain Reservoir
through a portion of the Aqueduct and discharging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
from these waste-weirs while the remainder of the channel-way,
or portions of it, would be drained so as to admit of
inspection or repairs. There are six of these waste-weirs
constructed for the Aqueduct.</p>

<h3>VENTILATORS.</h3>

<p>For the purpose of ventilation hollow cylinders of stone
are erected over the top of the Aqueduct and rising about
14 feet above the surface of the ground, or earth covering.
These occur every mile, and every third one is constructed
with a door to afford an entrance to the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>Those allowing an entrance have an interior diameter of
4 feet, and the others have an interior diameter of 2 feet;
each, however, slightly diminishing towards the top. An
iron grating covers the top to prevent any thing being
thrown in.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>. is a view of an entrance ventilator; this stands
on one side of the Aqueduct, where the masonry of the side
wall is enlarged for its base; we can descend from the door
and gain an entrance to the channel-way by an opening in
the side of the roofing arch. The sill of the door is about
12 feet above the bottom of the channel-way.</p>

<div id="i_88a" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 48em;">

  <p class="floatl"><i>F. B. Tower.</i></p> <p class="floatr"><i>Gimber.</i></p>
  <p class="floatc">ENTRANCE VENTILATOR</p></div>
</div>

<p>Those not intended for an entrance stand directly over the
top of the Aqueduct and are groined into the roofing arch.</p>

<p>Besides these Ventilators, there are openings 2 feet square
in the top of the roofing arch, every quarter of a mile: they
are covered with a flag stone and the place is marked by a
small stone monument projecting above the surface of the
ground. These may be useful to obtain entrance to the
Aqueduct, or to afford increased ventilation should it ever
become necessary.</p>

<h3>CULVERTS.</h3>

<p>Where streams intersect the line of Aqueduct, culverts
are built to allow them to pass under it. They are simply a
stone channel-way built under the Aqueduct of such form
and dimensions as will allow the stream to pursue its natural
direction without causing injury to the work. The foundation
of these culverts is formed by laying down concrete,
upon which an inverted arch of cut stone is laid forming the
bottom of the water-way: side walls of stone are built and
surmounted by an arch of stone. The span, or width of
water way, of the culverts built, varies from 1½ foot to 25
feet. Those of 1½ foot span have a square form for the
water-way, and are constructed by making a foundation of
concrete, upon which a flooring of well dressed stone is laid
forming the bottom of the water-way, and from this, side
walls are built and covered by a course of thick stone flagging
well dressed and closely fitted. At each end of the
culvert a deep wall is built underneath so as to prevent the
water from doing injury by undermining it. Buttresses and
wing walls are built at each end of the culvert to guide the
water to and from the channel-way, and a parapet wall is
built over the top of the channel-way at each end to sustain
the embankment of earth over the culvert. These wing
walls and parapets have various forms; sometimes the parapet
is built across the top of the culvert, and the wing
walls built at right angles to it, and sloping down to the buttresses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
and sometimes the wing walls and parapet form one
continuous wall of a semi-circular form, the top sloping up
from the buttresses in a plane parallel with the slope of the
embankment covering the Aqueduct above. These culverts
are permanently constructed, and in preparing the plans for
them much skill has been displayed in adapting the form
and size which the circumstances required, and much taste
displayed in the design for their construction.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>. is an isometrical drawing of one of the culverts
with rectangular wings and parapets; the body of the culvert
is cut in two in the drawing, showing that it may be of
any length, according to the width of the embankment
through which it is constructed. The length is generally
arranged so that the slope of the embankment may intersect
the rear of the top of the parapet and pursue a direction
down, parallel with the slope of the top of the wing walls.</p>

<h3><i>Gate Chamber at the Head of the Aqueduct and Grade of
the Water-way of the Aqueduct.</i></h3>

<p><a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>. is a longitudinal section through the <i>tunnel</i>
and <i>gate chamber</i> at the head of the Aqueduct showing its
connection with the <i>Fountain Reservoir</i>. This gate chamber
is not in any way connected with the dam itself, but
stands some distance from it, and the water reaches it by
means of the tunnel which leaves the Reservoir above the
dam and passes through the solid rock of the hill against
which the masonry of the dam is built, a distance of over
200 feet. This tunnel descends into the Reservoir, so that
the centre of it at the mouth is about 12 feet below the surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
of the water; any floating substance cannot enter it,
and during the winter season when the water is frozen over
no obstruction can take place to the flow into the Aqueduct,
and during the summer season the water will be drawn from
a level where it is cooler than at the surface.</p>

<p>The gate chamber has two ranges, or sets of gates; one
called <i>regulating gates</i>, and the other <i>guard gates</i>: the
regulating gates are made of gun metal, and work in frames
of the same material which are fitted to stone jambs and
lintels: the guard gates are made of cast iron, and work in
cast iron frames also attached to stone jambs and lintels.
The gates are all managed by means of wrought iron rods
attached to them, having a screw formed on the upper part on
which a brass nut works, being set in a cast iron socket-cap.</p>

<p>The bottom of the water way, of the Aqueduct, where
it leaves the gate chamber is 11.40 feet below the surface
of the Fountain Reservoir, and 154.77 feet above the level of
mean tide at the city of New-York. The following table
shows the length of the Aqueduct as it is divided into different
planes of descent, from the gate chamber at the Croton
dam to the gate chamber at the Receiving Reservoir on the
Island of New-York. Commencing at the south side of the
gate chamber at the Croton dam,</p>

rise again) to discharge the full quantity of water as freely
as the Aqueduct, or channel-way of masonry, would have
done had it continued its regular inclination across the
valley.</p>

<p>In crossing Manhattan Valley there is an <i>extra</i> fall of 3
feet for the same reasons as before stated for that at Harlem
River. In both cases, by using the pipes, there is a loss of
the head of water for the City Reservoirs, equal to the amount
of this <i>extra</i> fall; but this small loss of head was not considered
of such importance as to induce the building of
structures across these valleys up to the plane of Aqueduct
grade.</p>

<p>The bottom of the water-way of the Aqueduct at the gate
chamber where it enters the Receiving Reservoir, is 7.86
feet below the level of top water line in the Reservoir, thus
when the Reservoir is full the water will rise to within 7¼
inches of the top of the interior of the Aqueduct at that
place, and the height from top water to the top of the interior
will increase, going northward according to the inclination
of the plane of Aqueduct grade, until it reach the surface
level of the flow of water in the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>The height of the interior of the Aqueduct is 8 feet 5½
inches, and the greatest width is 7 feet 5 inches. The sectional
area of the interior is 53.34 square feet. On the <i>first
plane</i>, the Aqueduct is larger; being 2.05 feet higher at the
gate chamber, 2.31 feet higher at 2244. feet from the chamber,
and then diminishing, to the head of the second plane,
where it assumes the size above mentioned and continues of
that size throughout the remainder except in tunnels, where
it assumes the forms before described. Where the Aqueduct
on the <i>first plane</i> is larger, the width across the interior at
the spring line of the roofing arch is the same as the general
width, but the increase takes place only in the height of the
side walls, and the slope of the inner face of the walls being
the same, the width across at the spring line of the inverted
arch will be less according to the increased height of walls.
The original design was to continue the inclination which
the <i>second plane</i> has, up to the <i>Fountain Reservoir</i>; but it
was considered desirable to draw from this Reservoir at a
lower level, and the head of the Aqueduct was depressed for
that purpose, and a less inclination adopted for the length of
the <i>first plane</i>. The roofing arch was left on the same inclination
as was originally designed, except for the distance
of 2244. feet from the gate chamber, where it was built on a
level.</p>

<p>The curves which are used to change the direction of the
line of the Aqueduct are generally formed with a radius of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
500 feet; some have a radius of 1000 feet, and in a few instances
larger ones are adopted, but the majority of them
are of 500 feet radius.</p>

<p>The velocity of the water in the Aqueduct has been ascertained
to be about one mile and a half an hour when it is
2 feet deep; this was determined by floating <i>billets</i> of wood
from the Croton Dam to Harlem River and noting the time
of their passage. Such an experiment would express the
surface velocity and would give a greater velocity than it
would be proper to attribute to the <i>whole body</i> of water in
the Aqueduct; but the depth of water in the Aqueduct will
be probably 4 feet as soon as it is brought into general use,
and then there will be a corresponding increase in the velocity
of the <i>body</i> of water. This velocity of a <i>mile and a
half an hour</i> may be taken in general terms as the <i>velocity
of the water in the Aqueduct</i>.</p>

<p>The dam, built to form the Fountain Reservoir, is about
six miles above the mouth of the Croton River. The reservoir
forms a beautiful sheet of water in the lap of the hills
in the wild region of the Croton, and has received the name
of the “Croton Lake.”</p>

<p>Pine’s Bridge over the Croton River, which is mentioned
in the early history of the country, occupied a position which
is now about the middle of this Reservoir, and there is at
that place a bridge over the Reservoir resting upon piers and
abutments.</p>

<p>The hills which bound the Croton Valley where the Reservoir
is formed are so bold as to confine it within narrow
limits: for about two miles above the dam the average width
is about one eighth of a mile; at this distance from the dam
the valley opens so that for the length of two miles more
the width is about a quarter of a mile; here the valley contracts
again and diminishes the width until the flow line
reaches the natural width of the River at the head of the
lake. The country immediately contiguous to the shore has
been cleared up, and all that would be liable to impart any
impurity to the water has been removed. This gives a
pleasing aspect to the lake, showing where the hand of art
has swept along the shores leaving a clean margin. Retiring
from the water are the richly cultivated slopes with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
neat farm houses overlooking the lake, or the hills crowned
with forest trees, while at intervals a valley or ravine opens
and empties in its tributary stream.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>. is a view taken above the dam showing the
position of the entrance to the tunnel which leads from the
Reservoir to the gate chamber at the head of the Aqueduct.
The entablature which is seen on the left against the rock,
is built directly over the mouth of the tunnel, and from this
the tunnel extends through the rock to the gate house, which
is seen on the right of the picture and some distance from
the dam. The structure which is seen in the centre of the
picture and on the ridge of the dam is a gate house over a
culvert which extends through the body of the dam; this
culvert is 30 feet below the surface of water when the Reservoir
is full, and has gates which are operated by means
of rods which rise to the interior of the house. During low
stages of the River the water which is not drawn off by the
Aqueduct may pass through this culvert and allow none to
pass over the dam.</p>

<p>The entrance to the tunnel is protected by a screen of
timber work.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_X">Plate X</a>. is a representation of the entablature over the
mouth of the tunnel, showing the inscriptions upon it, relating

<p><a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI</a>. is a view taken from a point below the dam
and shows the relative positions of the dam and the gate
chamber at the head of the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>The original channel of the River where the dam is built,
was about 120 feet wide; the average depth of water at this
place was about 4 feet; and the greatest depth 10 feet.</p>

<p>The left bank of the river arose abruptly with rock, the
channel was gravelly, and on the right bank a sandy table
land about 3 feet above the ordinary surface of water extended
about 80 feet; then a sandy hill arose on a slope of
about forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>In making the plan for a dam at this place it was determined
to fill the main channel and the table land on the
right bank with an embankment of earth; and on the left
bank where rock was found, to build a body of masonry
against the slope to the requisite height for the surface of
the Reservoir and connect it with the embankment in the
channel; this masonry formed the overfall for the water,
and the rock in the side of the hill adjacent to it was excavated
down to the level of the overfall, thereby extending it
into the hill, making the space for the water to pass over
partly of masonry and partly of rock. The embankment
extended with a slope on the upstream side giving it a broad
base, and the lower or downstream side was faced with a
heavy wall of stone. There was a timber pier constructed
in the embankment extending across the channel and faced
with plank on the upstream side. The overfall was made of
such length as was thought sufficient to pass all the water of
the river during its highest stages, and with the view of
adapting it to such purpose, examinations were made to
find the highest marks of floods on the banks of the river;
and those who were engaged in determining these marks
were guided also by the observations of the inhabitants of
the vicinity who had long known the river in its various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
stages. High freshets were witnessed during the construction
of the work, for in the course of two years that the
work was going up, all the various changes and freshets of
rainy seasons were experienced, and those in charge of it
did not neglect to note the quantity of water flowing on such
occasions.</p>

</div>

<p>With such opportunities to become acquainted with the
changes of the stream they could not fail to know the quantity
of water flowing at periods of the highest freshets, and knowing
it, to adapt an overfall of sufficient capacity for its discharge.
For this purpose it was thought ample provision was
made; yet at the time when the work was nearly completed
such a flood occurred as could not have been anticipated from
previous knowledge of the River; the water filling the entire
passage at the overfall, flowed over the top of the embankment
where it was not supposed it could ever reach. The
lower slope of this embankment was covered with a wall
not calculated to resist the action of the water and it gave
way; the water broke through the embankment and rushed
along the valley with most disastrous consequences. The
breach occurred at an early hour in the morning; and many
persons were suddenly aroused from their sleep to escape
before the approaching waters. Dwelling-houses and mills
were carried away and three lives were lost. Two of those
who were drowned had taken refuge in the tops of trees,
but these being swept away they were drowned; while
others who were not able to reach the main land, but had
also taken refuge in trees, were saved. The change wrought
by the flood, in the appearance of the country, was truly
wonderful and the destruction was complete. Night had
closed over that valley where all was happiness and quiet,
but day opened upon a scene of desolation. The fertile
fields were torn up and covered with masses of stone and
gravel, and the flood left marks of its fury far up on the
hill sides.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the rain which caused this flood,
the ground was covered with snow to the depth of eighteen
inches: the weather became warm and the powerful rain
storm continued incessantly for forty-eight hours. Notwithstanding
the immense volume discharged at the overfall of
the dam, the water was rising, during the night previous to
this disaster, at the rate of fourteen inches per hour over the
Reservoir, covering an area of four hundred acres.</p>

<p>It occurred on the 8th of January, 1841.</p>

<p>In repairing the breach it was decided to build an extension
of solid hydraulic masonry in the place of the portion
of embankment which was carried away.</p>

<p>The gate house and wing wall, which is seen on the ridge
of the dam, shows where the masonry of the original structure
connected with the embankment which extended across
the river. The whole length of the overfall is 251 feet.
Access to the house over the culvert, is gained by a foot
bridge which is seen in the picture. The masonry of the
original structure has a rock foundation, and the extension
of the overfall which is seen on the left of the house extending
across to the embankment has an artificial foundation of
concrete.</p>

<p>The masonry of the dam is about 8 feet thick at the top
and 65 feet at the base; it is built in a vertical form on the
upstream side, with occasional offsets, and the lower face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
has a curved form such as to pass the water over without
giving it a direct fall upon the apron at the foot; this apron
is formed of timber, stone, and concrete; and extends some
distance from the toe of the masonry, giving security at the
point where the water has the greatest action. A secondary
dam has been built at a distance of 300 feet from the masonry
in order to form a basin of water setting back over
the apron at the toe of the main dam so as to break the
force of the water falling upon it. This secondary dam is
formed of round timber, brush wood, and gravel; it may be
seen in the picture directly under the bridge which extends
across below the main structure.</p>

<p>On the upstream side of the masonry of the dam, an embankment
of earth is filled in, extending 275 feet from the
masonry at the base, and extending from the masonry with
a slope of 1 foot in 5 on the top.</p>

</div>

<p>The whole work about the dam possesses great interest,
and though it be distant from the city and somewhat difficult
of access, will not fail to please those who may take time to
visit it. Just above the place where the dam is constructed
the River had a bold turn and flowed along at the foot of a
steep and rugged bank. A road passed along at the base of
this hill leading to a mill which was situated at the turn of
the River, before mentioned; a substitute for this road, which
was submerged, has been made along the hill side passing on
the right of the gate house. Enough of the forest has been
cleared away to admit of the construction of the work, but
the place still possesses much of its original wildness, and to
see such beautiful mechanical work standing against the
rude rocks,—to observe what changes have been wrought
in the form of this rock to render it subservient to the purposes
of the work, makes us feel that there has been a strife
there; but it all shows that <i>art</i> has gained the ascendency.</p>

<p>The form which has been adopted for the face of the extension
of the overfall is a reversed or double curve which
would be easily recognized as <i>Hogarth’s line of beauty</i>:
the overfall for the original dam has a plane face with a
curve at the base.</p>

<p>Walks are formed about the work bordered with grass,
giving a neatness and finished appearance to the whole;
and every thing in connection seems to indicate that the
vicinity of the <i>Croton Dam</i> will be one of the resorts in
summer seasons for the citizens of New-York. From the
Croton Dam the Aqueduct passes along the left side of the
valley of the Croton River until at the mouth of this river it
reaches the left bank of the Hudson, which it pursues, keeping
at a distance of nearly half a mile from the River, until
it arrives at the village of Sing-Sing, which is eight miles
from the dam. In the course of this distance the Aqueduct
passes through four tunnels and encounters many valleys
and ravines where high foundation walls were required, and
culverts for the passage of the streams.</p>

<p>At the village of Sing-Sing there are two Aqueduct
bridges; one over a public road-way, and the other over the
Sing-Sing Kill. These bridges and the adjacent work form
a very interesting point on the line of Aqueduct.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII</a>. is a view of the Aqueduct at this place: at the
left of the picture may be seen the bridge over the road, and
on the right that over the Kill. The bridge over the road
has a span of 20 feet, and the direction of the road-way being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
not at right angles with the line of Aqueduct required
the arch to be built askew; the arch lies in the direction of
the road-way, having the ends in planes parallel with the
direction of the Aqueduct. This bridge is worthy of notice,
but public attention is more generally directed to the larger
one: <i>that</i> has an arch of 88 feet span and a rise of 33 feet;
the form of the arch is elliptical, being a compound curve
drawn from five different centres, or radius points. The
Kill, or valley over which this arch stands, is a deep narrow
gorge worn by a small stream which empties into the Hudson
River.</p>

<p>The bottom of the ravine is about 70 feet below the
soffit or under side of the arch. <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>. is another
view of the large arch taken from the bottom of the valley
near it, and shows the bridge which has been constructed
for a public road passing under it, and the mill near by.</p>

</div>

<p>This arch presents a singularly bold appearance, vaulting
over the roadway and rising high up above the old mill, and
what adds much to this boldness, is the narrowness of the
arch, or small distance from one end of it to the other; being
only 23⅓ feet long at the springing line while the span is
nearly four times this length. The length of the arch diminishes
towards the crown, the ends being in planes not vertical,
but inclining towards each other at the top. Each end
has a batter or inclination of one twenty fourth of its height,
or half an inch to the foot. The arch is built of granite, is
3 feet thick at the crown and 4 feet at the spring or base.
The abutments have a foundation of solid rock which was
excavated in proper form to give them firm footing. The
whole structure presents a degree of stability which seems
to defy the effects of time. The Aqueduct has a cast iron
lining over this bridge (as it has over all of this character):
it is formed of plates five eighths of an inch thick, put
together with screw-bolts and nuts and the joints closely
filled with iron cement. This lining is within the brick
work of the bottom and sides of the channel-way, having
four inches of brick outside of it and four inside. The
object of it is to prevent any water dripping through the
work, lest by any means it should fill the exterior masonry
of the bridge with moisture and thus render it liable to injury
from frost. Other precautions are taken in forming the
masonry about the channel-way, to prevent this exuding, and
the whole plan of the work shows foresight and precaution
worthy of the highest praise.</p>

<p>From the Sing-Sing Kill the Aqueduct pursues a course
along the east bank of the Hudson and the first work of peculiar
interest is the Aqueduct bridge over the road from
Tarrytown to Sing-Sing; before it reaches this place it
passes through three tunnels, over high foundation walls,
and encounters deep excavations.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Plate_XIV">Plate XIV</a>. is a view of this bridge: it is eleven and a
quarter miles from the dam. The arch is 20 feet span and
has a versed sine or rise of 5 feet. From this the Aqueduct
passes on, encounters one tunnel, and reaches the valley of Mill
River, twelve miles and three quarters from the dam. This
River runs through Sleepy Hollow and enters the Hudson
about a mile and a half above Tarrytown. The stream is
72 feet below the bottom of the Aqueduct, and the valley
being of considerable width required a very heavy foundation
wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XV">Plate XV</a>. is a view of the <i>Mill River Culvert</i>: it is 25
feet span and 172 feet long. It is about half a mile east of
the road leading from Tarrytown to Sing-Sing, and to follow
the course of the stream which passes through it, it is three
quarters of a mile to the <i>Old Dutch Church</i>, near Tarrytown,
which is well known, and familiar to every one who
has read Irving’s “Legend of Sleepy Hollow.”</p>

<p>There is much of the wildness and beauty of nature about
this place; the woods are standing close upon the work,—the
stream which passes through the culvert displays its
whitened crests as it tears along over the rocky bed, and
utters its music until it is lost in the depth of the forest.
The wild vines will soon climb the walls and cover them;
vegetation will gather over the work until <i>nature</i> and <i>art</i>
be harmoniously <i>wedded</i>.</p>

<p>From Mill River the Aqueduct passes the village of
Tarrytown and through one tunnel and over several depressions
and streams, reaching Jewell’s Brook which is
seventeen and a half miles from the dam. This stream
enters the Hudson River about two miles below Tarrytown.
The distance from the mouth of the stream to the line of
Aqueduct is only a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XVI">Plate XVI</a>. is a view of the work at Jewell’s Brook.
The culvert for the stream is 6 feet span and 148 feet
long. The larger culvert for a private road is 14 feet span
and 141 feet long. The wall which supports the Aqueduct
at this valley is 50 feet high.</p>

<p>In this case, as in many others, the slope wall which
covers the face of the embankment has an arch turned in
it over the top of the culverts: the object of this is to
prevent the direct pressure of the wall upon the top of the
parapet wall, as it would tend to displace the coping or injure
the parapet itself.</p>

</div>

<p>After crossing Jewell’s Brook the Aqueduct passes along
the bank of the Hudson through the village of Dobb’s Ferry,
where there is a tunnel and a valley requiring a culvert, and
continues from this place to the village of Hastings, where
there is an Aqueduct bridge over a rail-road which is used
for transporting marble from the quarry near by, to the landing
on the Hudson River.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XVII">Plate XVII</a>. is a view of this bridge and the view under
the arch shows the face of the quarry which is near the
work; the landing at the river is near by, giving a very
rapid descent from the quarry. The arch has a span of 16
feet and a rise of 1½ foot. This bridge is twenty-one miles
from the dam.</p>

<p>From Hastings the Aqueduct continues along the bank of
the Hudson until it reaches the village of Yonkers where it
leaves the valley of the Hudson, and passing through a tunnel
of considerable length reaches the valley of Saw-Mill
River. At the crossing of this valley there is a culvert of
20 feet span for a public road to pass under the Aqueduct,
and one having two arches each 25 feet span for the river.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XVIII">Plate XVIII</a>. is a view of the work at Saw Mill River.</p>

<p>The water is set back at this place by a dam for a mill a
short distance below, giving the stream an appearance of
more magnitude than it really possesses. This point is 25
miles from the dam. The wall which supports the Aqueduct
over this valley is 40 feet high.</p>

<p>From Saw-Mill River the Aqueduct passing through one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
tunnel soon reaches Tibbit’s Brook, which it crosses by
means of a foundation wall about 30 feet high and a culvert
of 6 feet span, and continues along the south side of the
valley of this brook, thence to the Harlem River which it
crosses at one mile from McComb’s Dam. This crossing
is thirty-three miles from the Croton Dam, and about ten
miles from the City-Hall.</p>

<p>The distance across this valley is about a quarter of a
mile, and the surface of the River is 120 feet below the
bottom of the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>In all the examinations which were made with a view of
bringing water from Westchester County, the crossing of
this River, or <i>arm of the sea</i>, was regarded as the most
formidable work that would be encountered; various plans
were proposed, and in presenting these plans the project
was such as to call into requisition much talent and skill.</p>

<p>An Aqueduct Bridge built of stone, having arches resting
upon piers and abutments, was proposed so as to continue
the Aqueduct across with its regular inclination.</p>

<p>An Inverted Syphon of iron pipes was proposed; the
pipes to descend to a level near the surface of the River,
and passing along upon a stone embankment rise again and
connect with the Aqueduct: in this stone embankment an
arch was to be built of sufficient dimensions to allow free
passage of the water of the River.</p>

<div id="i_106a" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">

</div>

<p>Another plan was proposed which, though novel in its
application to such purpose, was worthy of consideration:
this was to build a Suspension Bridge of wire cables reaching
across the valley, supported at intervals upon suitable
stone piers. This, maintaining the regular inclination of
the Aqueduct, would support iron pipes. The design was
a bold one, yet instances where such bridges have been constructed
for road-ways afford examples of the feasibility and
permanency of the structures, and prove that the application
of that principle for this purpose was not a visionary project.</p>

<p>The plan which was adopted as the most suitable under
all the considerations of economy and security to the work,
was a <i>Low Bridge</i> to support an inverted syphon of iron
pipes; and the design of it was as follows: adjacent to the
southern shore of the river there was to be constructed an
arch for the channel of the river, of 80 feet span and springing
from abutments 10 feet above high water level; this
would form a passage of 80 feet wide, and the height from
high water level to the under side of the arch at the crown
would be 50 feet: south of this arch followed three other
arches on the slope of the rocky hill, of 35, 30, and 25 feet
span: south of these arches a foundation wall was designed
to continue the plane of inclination to the level of the Aqueduct.
From the large arch to the northern shore of the
river an embankment of stone was designed for the support
of the pipes, and from this wall the table land on the northern
shore and the slope of the northern side of the valley, would
be excavated to a form to give the proper position to the
pipes descending from the Aqueduct. The lowest level of
the top of this stone embankment was designed to be 4 feet
above flood tide. Suitable parapet walls were designed to
be built along the sides of the embankment to sustain a
covering of earth over the pipes. With the form which was
given to this <i>inverted syphon</i>, four pipes, each of 3 feet interior
diameter, were found to give a discharge of water equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
to that of the Aqueduct of masonry on the established inclination.</p>

<p>In accordance with this plan of the <i>Low Bridge</i> the work
for crossing the River was put under contract and some progress
made in its execution, when a law was passed by the
Legislature of the State requiring, instead of this, a structure,
the arches of which should be (over the channel of the river)
at least 80 feet span and having a distance of 100 feet from
the level of high water to the under side of the crown; or to
go under the channel of the river by a structure which
should not rise above the bed, and that would leave the
present channel unobstructed. At this time when the work
was going on vigorously, they were compelled to abandon
the plan which had been adopted, and devise one which
would comply with the requirements of the law of the Legislature.
A comparison was instituted between the plan of
a tunnel under the bed of the river and that of a bridge of
masonry at the required height above the river.</p>

<p>The tunnel would be at least 300 feet long and the top of
the masonry forming it, would be 18 feet below high water
level. In this tunnel the iron pipes would pass under the
River and would be protected from the salt water.</p>

</div>

<p>An estimate of the cost of crossing by means of each
plan was made, and the result was in favor of the tunnel
under the bed of the River; but from the imperfect knowledge
which could at best be obtained of the formation of
the bed, there was great uncertainty in the estimate of the
cost of the tunnel and the time that would be required for its
completion. The history of the progress of work in the
tunnel under the Thames at London warned them of the
difficulties of such a work and the uncertainty of arriving
at a proper estimate of the cost.</p>

<p>In the alternative to which they were driven by the Act
of the Legislature, the plan of an Aqueduct bridge of
masonry was adopted as the proper one for crossing the
River; but in establishing its altitude they complied <i>only</i>
with the requisitions of the law, and made the soffit or under
side of the arches at the crown, 100 feet above common high
water level. This would not carry the work up to the level
of the Aqueduct, and would render it necessary to connect
the Aqueduct on each side of the valley by iron pipes
which would descend to the level of the bridge and crossing
it rise again to the masonry channel-way. The plans which
were before spoken of for a bridge of masonry across this
valley, contemplated a structure which would maintain the
regular inclination of the Aqueduct; and the channel-way
would have been formed of masonry having a cast iron
lining; but a more full consideration of the subject suggested
the propriety of using iron pipes over the bridge, even if
it had been carried up to the grade plane of the Aqueduct:
when the use of iron pipes was determined upon, then
considerations of economy induced them to build the work
<i>only</i> high enough to comply with the requirements of the
law.</p>

<p>The plan which has been adopted for building an Aqueduct
bridge across this valley is as follows: on the south shore of
the river there is one arch of 50 feet span, across the river
there are eight arches, each of 80 feet span, and on the
north shore there are six arches each of 50 feet span;
making a range of fifteen arches. From the extremes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
this range of arches, a foundation wall of dry stone work
connects with the Aqueduct.</p>

<p>Two of the piers in the river have a rock foundation and
the foundations for those where rock is not obtained is
formed by driving piles which are placed 2½ feet from centre
to centre, and the spaces between filled with concrete to a
depth of 3 feet below the top of them.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XIX">Plate XIX</a>. is a view of this bridge, which, when completed,
will be the most interesting work on the whole line
of Aqueduct, and in its appearance will rival the grandeur of
similar works of the Ancient Romans. The height from
the foundations in the river, to the top of the work is 150
feet; the width across the top is 21 feet. The pipes when
laid upon the bridge will be covered with earth to protect
them from frost. The distance between the extremes of the
pipes when laid across the bridge will be 1377⅓ feet. For a
distance of 18 feet at each end of the pipes there is an inclination
and the remainder of the distance across, which is
1341⅓ feet, they are level.</p>

<p>The bottom of the interior of the pipes on the level part,
is 12-8/10 feet below the bottom of water way of the Aqueduct
on the north side, and 10-5/10 below that on the south side of
the valley.</p>

<p>In the progress of excavating in one of the coffer dams
in the channel of the river a portion of a sunken vessel was
found within the enclosure; it had the appearance of great
age. Tradition among the inhabitants of the vicinity says
that at an early period of the Revolutionary war a vessel
was scuttled and sunk in that part of the river.</p>

</div>

<p>To a mind fond of antiquarian researches and accustomed
to invest objects of such a nature with associations of the
past, this ancient wreck would furnish a fruitful theme. We
are now laying the foundation of a magnificent work: at
the day when this vessel was sunk the American people
were laying the foundation of a new form of government
composed of principles which should support a fabric of
enduring strength and beauty. We are now building a work
which will stand as a monument of the genius and enterprise
of the age, but it may be regarded among the fruits of
that civil and religious liberty which has been reared upon
the foundations formed by the people of that day.</p>

<p>The water is now conveyed across this valley by an iron
pipe of 3 feet interior diameter. In the progress of preparing
foundations for the piers of the bridge, an embankment
has been formed across the River and the pipe leaving
the Aqueduct on the north side of the valley follows down
the slope of the hill, and crossing over the River upon this
embankment, ascends on the south side again to the Aqueduct.
At the bottom or lowest point in this pipe, a branch
pipe of 1 foot diameter has been connected, extending a
distance of 80 feet from it at right angles and horizontally:
the end of this pipe is turned upwards to form a jet, and
iron plates are fastened upon it giving any form that may
be desired to the water issuing. The level of this branch
pipe is about 120 feet below the bottom of the Aqueduct on
the north side of the valley; affording an opportunity for a
beautiful <i>jet d’eau</i>;—such an one as cannot be obtained at
the fountains in the city. From an orifice of seven inches
diameter the column of water rises to a height of 115 feet
when there is only a depth of 2 feet of water in the
Aqueduct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>To those who had watched over the work during its construction
and looked for its successful operation, this was
peculiarly gratifying. To see the water leap from this
opening and rise upwards with such force and beauty,
occasioned pleasing emotions and gave proof that the design
and construction of the work were alike faultless, and
that all the fondest hopes of its projectors would be realized.</p>

<p>The scenery around this fountain added much to its
beauty; there it stood,—a whitened column rising from the
river, erect, or shifting its form, or waving like a forest tree
as the winds swayed it, with the rainbow tints resting upon
its spray, while on either side the wooded hills arose to
rival its height: all around was of <i>nature</i>; no marble
basin,—no allegorical figures, wrought with exquisite touches
of <i>art</i> to lure the eye, but a fountain where nature had
adorned the place with the grandeur and beauty of her rude
hills and mountain scenery.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XX">Plate XX</a>. is a distant view of the jet at Harlem River.</p>

<p>From Harlem River the Aqueduct passes along the south
bank of the River for a short distance where it rests in the
side of the rocky hill, and continues over an uneven surface
encountering two tunnels before it reaches Manhattan Valley,
which is about 35 miles from the Croton dam. This
valley is four fifths of a mile wide where the Aqueduct
meets it, and the depression is 102 feet below the plane of
Aqueduct grade.</p>

</div>

<p>Here was an opportunity for constructing a work of
architectural beauty and boldness by building up with arcades
of arches, one line above another, and thus maintain
the regular inclination of the Aqueduct; but considerations
of economy forbade it. Where the Aqueduct reaches the
north side of the valley, a gate chamber is formed, and from
this, two pipes of 3 feet interior diameter descend to the
bottom of the valley and ascend on the south side to another
gate chamber where they connect with the Aqueduct again.
Provision is made for four pipes of 3 feet diameter, but at
present only two are laid which answer the demands of the
city at this time. At the bottom of the valley waste cocks
are provided which discharge into a sewer leading to the
Hudson River, a distance of half a mile.</p>

<p>The lowest point in the pipes is 102 feet below the bottom
of the water way of the Aqueduct on the north side of
the valley.</p>

<p>From Manhattan Valley the Aqueduct passes through a
tunnel, and following its course the next work of interest is
at Clendinning Valley, which is thirty-seven miles from the
Croton Dam. This valley is 1900 feet across, and the
Aqueduct is supported upon a foundation wall of dry stone
work having the face laid in mortar, except over three streets
where bridges are built, having an arch of 30 feet span for
the carriage-way and one on each side of 10½ feet span for
the side walks. These bridges are over 98th, 99th, and
100th streets.</p>

<p>The greatest height from the foundation to the top of the

is 30 feet. Parapet walls are built on the sides of the wall

<p>These bridges are beautiful specimens of mechanical
work; indeed the whole structure across this valley has a
degree of neatness, finish, and taste, not surpassed by any
on the line of Aqueduct.</p>

<p>To visit this structure and follow along its whole extent,
gives one an idea of the magnitude of the work which the
City of New-York has accomplished; particularly when it
is considered that this is only one of the <i>parts</i> which make
up the <i>whole</i>.</p>

<p>From Clendinning Valley the Aqueduct soon reaches the
Receiving Reservoir which is thirty-eight miles from the
Croton Dam.</p>

<p>This Reservoir occupies an elevated part of the island
between 79th and 86th streets and between the 6th and 7th
Avenues. It covers seven of the city blocks; is divided
into two divisions, one covering three and the other four of
these blocks. It is 1826 feet long and 836 feet wide from
outside to outside of the top of the exterior walls of the
embankment, making an area of thirty-five acres.</p>

<div id="i_114a" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 54em;">

</div>

<p>The situation was chosen as one affording the proper
elevation: but its formation was such as to present difficulties
in the way of making the Reservoir perfectly water-tight;
the surface, in tracing it from 79th to 86th street, was quite
undulating, a portion of it in the southern division of the Reservoir
falling below the proposed bottom, and that portion
of the surface which was earth, forming only a covering to
the rock, which over the whole island, presents a singularly
broken and uneven formation. In almost every instance of
excavation, the rock was found above the proposed bottom
of the Reservoir, and the difficulty of preventing leakage
along the surface of this rock may easily be conceived; but
considering that measures are taken to prevent such an
occurrence, another difficulty is still presented in the formation
of the rock: the veins and fissures which are frequent
in this gneiss formation would possibly afford courses for
the water to escape; the rock being unsound in many instances,
would render such an occurrence still more liable.
A Reservoir has however, been constructed here which
proved, when it was filled with water, that sufficient precaution
was used to prevent leakage, and that the difficulties
which presented themselves before the commencement of
the work were no longer to be feared.</p>

<p>The embankments forming the Reservoir are made of
good assorted earth, and a portion of the bank is puddled,
or made compact and impervious by wetting the earth and
using a spade to force it into a compact state. They are
about 20 feet wide on the top, and increase in thickness towards
the base by a slope on both sides: the outside face of
the Reservoir bank has a slope of 1 foot horizontal to 3 feet
vertical: the inside has a slope of 1½ foot horizontal to 1
foot vertical. The outside face is protected by a stone wall
4 feet thick having the face laid in mortar: the inside face is
protected by a slope wall of stone laid without mortar, 1¼
foot thick. The top of the bank is 4 feet above top water
line, and the inside slope wall terminates at 2 feet above top
water line, leaving the remainder of the face to be covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
with grass, so as to present a belt of green above the water
on the bank entirely around the Reservoir.</p>

<p>A neat fence bounds the outside and the inside of the top
bank, forming a walk of a mile in length around the entire
Reservoir.</p>

<p>The greatest depth of water in the northern division is 20
feet: it was originally intended to excavate so as to give the
water a depth of 20 feet over the whole, but a quantity of
rock was left, as the capacity was thought to be sufficient
without taking it out.</p>

<p>The southern division has 30 feet of water where the
bottom was filled in with embankment, and 25 where excavation
was made. A portion of rock was left in this division
for the same reason as that in the northern division; the
greater part of it being in the south-west corner, where it
rises above top water line.</p>

<p>The capacity of the Reservoir when both divisions are
full, is 150,000,000 Imperial gallons.</p>

<p>The surface of water in the northern division covers 18.13
acres, and in the southern division, 12.75 acres; making in
both nearly 31 acres.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XXIII">Plate XXIII</a>. is a plan of the Receiving Reservoir.</p>

<p>The Aqueduct enters a gate chamber at A. where there
are regulating gates by which the water can be discharged
into the northern division; or into the southern division by a
continuation of the Aqueduct within the Reservoir bank to
the angle B. of that division.</p>

</div>

<p>A connection pipe of cast iron is placed in the division
bank at C. to allow the water to flow from one division into
the other in order to equalize the level; it is placed 10 feet
below top water line and has a stop-cock to close or open it.</p>

<p>At D. is a waste weir, where surplus water may pass off:
it is so arranged that the water, when it rises to a proper
level, will flow into a well, and from this a brick sewer conducts
it off into low grounds, where it finds its way to the
East River.</p>

<p>At each place where it is designed to discharge water
from the Reservoir, a gate house is built far enough into it to
reach the greatest depth of water beyond the slope of the
embankment. These houses have a wall upon three sides,
and the front which faces the centre of the Reservoir has
a suitable screen of wood work and wooden gates which
regulate the level below the surface for the current of discharge,
and the iron pipes leading from these houses have a
stop-cock by which the discharge is controlled; this stop-cock
is in a vault within the Reservoir bank.</p>

<p>The position of these effluent gate houses is marked on
the plan by the letters E, F, G, H, there being two in each
division. A foot bridge affords convenient access from the
bank to the house.</p>

<p>Those houses on the east side denoted by E, F, are the
ones from which pipes lead to the lower or Distributing
Reservoir, and those on the west side denoted by G, H, are
intended for supplying the western part of the city north of
the Distributing Reservoir.</p>

<p>There is a vault within the eastern bank to accommodate
the pipes which leave the house E, and passing along, connect
with those from the house F, and thence the pipes
continue along 80th street and the 5th Avenue to the Distributing
Reservoir. A vault within the west bank accommodates
the pipe which leads from the house H, and intersects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
the one from G, passing out at 81st street; thus in this
street a pipe draws from the southern division at G, and a
branch of it passing along within the vault draws from the
northern division at H.</p>

<p>Provision has been made on the east side of the Reservoir
for supplying that part of the city when it becomes
necessary.</p>

<p>At present there are two pipes leading from this to the
Distributing Reservoir, each 3 feet interior diameter, and
they are arranged that both may draw from the southern
division, or one from that, and one from the northern division.
The pipes are placed at a level below the bottom of
the division from which they draw: the bottom of the interior
of those from the southern division being 2 feet below,
and that of those from the northern 5 feet below.</p>

<p>The exterior walls of this Reservoir present a face of
<i>rough-hammered</i> masonry, finished in a manner to give
them neatness and durability.</p>

<p>As a specimen of mechanical work, this Reservoir will
not bear a comparison with the lower, or Distributing Reservoir,
yet the sheet of water it presents, renders it an object
of perhaps greater interest. This beautiful lake of pure
water resting upon the summit of the Island is truly a pleasing
object, and considering its size, is what no other city
can boast of having within its limits.</p>

<p>The Distributing Reservoir is situated on the west side of
the 5th Avenue between 40th and 42nd streets; it is two
miles from the Receiving Reservoir, and about three miles
from the City-Hall.</p>

</div>

<p>The question may naturally be asked, why this Reservoir
was built, when the receiving one, of such great capacity, is
so near at hand? The reason for building it, was to obtain
an efficient head of water near to the densely populated
parts of the city, and had the formation of the island been
favorable, the Receiving Reservoir would undoubtedly have
been located farther down, bringing the store of water more
nearly in the centre of the city.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XXIV">Plate XXIV</a>. is an isometrical view of the Distributing
Reservoir showing the front on the 5th Avenue and on
42nd street.</p>

<p>The pipes which leave the Receiving Reservoir follow
along the 5th Avenue until they reach 42nd street, where
they turn and enter the Distributing Reservoir at the base of
the central pilaster in that street, which in the drawing is
shown on the right hand side. The pipes enter at the bottom
of the Reservoir and the flow of water is regulated by <i>stop-cocks</i>:
the door in the pilaster affords an entrance to the
vault where these <i>stop-cocks</i> are situated. The Reservoir
is divided into two separate divisions by a wall. It is designed
to have three pipes, each 3 feet diameter, to lead from
the Receiving to the Distributing Reservoir and arrangements
are made to discharge water from two of them into
one division of the Distributing Reservoir at a time, or the
water may be divided into an equal supply for both divisions.</p>

<p>On the south side of the Reservoir a pipe of 3 feet diameter
leaves each division and they are arranged with branches
so as to draw from one or both divisions. The house
standing across the division wall is directly over the mouth
of the effluent pipes, and is constructed like those at the
Receiving Reservoir, with a gate and screen frame of timber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
The central pilaster on 40th street has an entrance (like
that on 42nd street) to the vault where the <i>stop-cocks</i> are
situated which regulate the discharge from the Reservoir.
The pipes leave the Reservoir at the base of this pilaster
and from 40th street, curve into the 5th Avenue, which they
pursue until they reach a convenient point for diverging to
the densely populated parts of the city.</p>

<p>This Reservoir is 420 feet square on the top, measuring
on the cornice of the main wall; it is 425 feet square at the
top of the cornice of the pilasters, and 436 feet square at the
base, measuring from outside to outside of the corner pilasters,
covering a little over four acres. The height of the
walls is 45 feet above the streets around, and about 50 feet
above the foundations.</p>

<p>The water is 36 feet deep when it reaches the level designed
for its surface (which is 4 feet below the top of the
walls) and the surplus, when the Reservoir is full, passes into
a well in the division wall and is conducted by a sewer in
42nd street to the Hudson River, which is one mile distant.</p>

<p>The Reservoir is calculated to hold 20,000,000 gallons.</p>

<p>The outside walls are constructed with openings in them
so that by entering the door on 42nd street one may walk
entirely around the Reservoir within the walls. One object
of this arrangement is to obtain the greatest breadth with a
given quantity of material; another is to afford an opportunity
to examine the work so as to guard against leakage;
and another, to prevent any moisture finding its way through
to the exterior so as to cause injury to the wall by the action
of frost. This kind of open work of the wall rises to within
about 8 feet of top water line. Inside of these walls an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
embankment of puddled earth is formed with suitable breadth
of base to give security to the work, and the face of this
earth next to the water is covered with a wall of hydraulic
masonry 1¼ foot thick. The top of the embankment is
covered with stone flagging, forming a walk around the top
of the Reservoir. The bottom of the Reservoir has a covering
of concrete 1 foot thick; thus when it is empty there
will be seen two basins having the sides and bottom formed
of masonry.</p>

<p>A section of the wall of one side of the Reservoir, including
the embankment, is 17 feet wide at the top, 35 feet
wide 16 feet below the top, and 76 feet wide at the bottom:
the cornice projects on the outside and the coping on the
inside so as to make the width of the top 21 feet. An iron
railing bounds the outside and inside of the walk around
the top.</p>

<p>The outside of the Reservoir is built on a slope of one
sixth its height, or two inches to the foot, and an Egyptian
cornice projects at the top of the main walls and the pilasters.</p>

<p>At the entrance on the 5th Avenue a stairway leads up to
the top of the Reservoir.</p>

<p>Terraces are built around at the foot of the walls and
covered with grass, giving a rich finish to the work.</p>

<p>This Reservoir may be considered the termination of the
Croton Aqueduct, and is distant from the <i>Fountain Reservoir</i>
on the Croton, forty and a half miles.</p>

<p>The whole cost of the work, exclusive of the pipes in the
city below the Distributing Reservoir, is about 9,000,000
dollars. Adding to this the cost of pipes and arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
for distributing the water in the city, will make the <i>total
cost of supplying the city of New-York with water about
12,000,000 dollars</i>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The water was introduced into the Distributing Reservoir
on the 4th of July, 1842, and the event was hailed by the
citizens of New-York with an interest scarcely less than
that pervading the whole American people at the remembrance
of the event, the anniversary of which, was on that
day celebrated.</p>

<p>At an hour when the firing of guns and the ringing of
bells had aroused but few from their slumbers, and ere the
rays of the morning sun had gilded the city domes, the
waters of the Croton gushed up into the Reservoir and
wandered about its bottom as if to examine the magnificent
structure; or to find a resting place in the <i>temple</i> towards
which they had made a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The national flag floated out from each corner of the
Reservoir, and during the day thousands of the citizens
visited it giving demonstrations of joy and satisfaction at
the accomplishment of this great work.</p>

<p>The 14th of October following was set apart as a day
for the celebration of the introduction of the water into the
city: and it was an occasion of unrestrained enthusiasm and
joy. Multitudes came in from the country around, and from
sister cities:—all business was laid aside for the pleasing
ceremonies of the day, and the Croton water, with the beauty
and grandeur of its fountains, met with a welcome which
showed that its value was appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>The advantages, the comforts and blessings of this supply
of pure water will be appreciated as the city extends the
means for its use, and the time is not distant when she will
regard it as a treasure which was cheaply purchased, and
will proudly point to the noble work which she has achieved
not only as an example of her munificence, but as an illustration
of what <i>art</i> and <i>science</i> can accomplish.</p>

<p>With cleanly streets, and the public parks beautified
with the fountains which send forth cooling and refreshing
vapours upon the air, the citizens will forget to leave the city
during the warm months of summer, and the <i>sea-shore</i>, the
<i>mountain-tops</i>, and <i>watering-places</i>, will fancy their beauty
has faded, since they cease to be visited.</p>

<p>The foreigner who visits this country will find the Croton
Aqueduct an interesting specimen of our <i>public works</i>, and
will be pleased with a pedestrian tour along the line of work
to the Fountain Reservoir among the hills of the Croton.
Besides becoming acquainted with the important features
of the work, he may enjoy much that is beautiful in American
scenery. In his course along the Aqueduct he may see
the majestic palisades which for a distance <i>wall</i> the right
bank of the Hudson; he may view the Tappan and Haverstraw
bays with their ever-varying scenery, and the dark
gorge where the Hudson emerges from the Highlands with
its white bosom.</p>

<p>Along the Aqueduct there are also many picturesque
scenes where the mountain stream leaps among the rocks
in the deep ravine which guides its course to the Hudson.</p>

<p>The country is interesting also from the associations with
which it has been invested by the pen of our novelists. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
region of the Croton where the Fountain Reservoir is
formed, is a part of the district where the scene of the
“Tale of the Neutral Ground” is laid; and one may fancy
there the figure of Harvey Birch, beneath his <i>pondrous
pack</i>, casting a shadow at night along the moon-lit slopes.</p>

<p>Leaving the valley of the Croton we come out upon the
Hudson at the head of the “<i>great waters of the Tappan
Zee</i>,” beyond which the early inhabitants of <i>New-Amsterdam</i>
dared not to voyage without first “settling their family
affairs, and making their wills.”</p>

<p>As we approach Tarrytown we find the localities which
were pictured in the “Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” and easily
recognize the Old Dutch Church near which the affrighted
Ichabod Crane was so sadly unhorsed by the headless
Hessian. We find in this vicinity also, the place noted as
the “<i>spot where the unfortunate ‘Andre’ was captured</i>.”</p>

<p>Besides the romantic and diversified scenery of the Hudson
which is in view from the line of Aqueduct, the visitor
may find highly cultivated grounds and delightful country
seats, and among them that of our distinguished countryman,
Washington Irving, where he sought a rural retirement for
his literary pursuits. But it is unnecessary to speak further
of the objects which are calculated to interest the visitor to
this part of the country: we would only invite the stranger
who visits the city of New-York to go forth and visit her
noble Aqueduct: when he has become acquainted with the
magnitude and grandeur of its construction, then he may
turn aside for prospects to admire and incidents to interest.</p>

<h3>WATER.</h3>

<p class="p1 center b1">(<i>Chiefly compiled from the works of Thomson, Pereira, Whewell and others.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Water</span> was regarded by the ancients as an elementary substance, and as a constituent
of most other bodies. This opinion was somewhat modified by the experiments
of Van Helmont and Mr. Boyle, who maintained that it could be changed
into all vegetable substances, as well as into earth; but it was substantially held
until the middle of the last century, (1781,) when Mr. Cavendish proved that this
liquid was a compound of oxygen and hydrogen.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Natural History.</span> <i>In the inorganized kingdom.</i></h4>

<p>Water is very generally diffused over the surface of the globe, forming seas, lakes,
and rivers; it is mechanically disseminated among rocks, constitutes an essential
part of some minerals, and always exists to a greater or less extent, in the atmosphere.
In the air, water is formed in two states; as a <i>vapor</i> (which makes about
one-seventieth by volume, or one one-hundredth by weight of the atmosphere) it is
supposed to be the cause of the blue color to the sky; and in a <i>vesicular form</i>, in
which state it constitutes the clouds. Terrestrial water forms about three-fourths of
the surface of the terraqueous globe. The average depth of the ocean is calculated
at between two and three miles. Now as the height of dry land above the surface
of the sea is less than two miles, it is evident, that if the present dry land were distributed
over the bottom of the ocean, the surface of the globe would present a mass
of waters a mile in depth. On the supposition that the mean depth of the sea is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
greater than the fourth part of a mile, the solid contents of the ocean would be
32,058,939 cubic miles (<i>Thomson’s Chemistry</i>.) The quantity of water mechanically
disseminated through rocks, which serve merely as a natural reservoir for the
time, must be, in the aggregate, very considerable, though it is impossible to form
any very accurate estimate of it. Even in those rocks which merely supply springs,
the amount of disseminated water must be enormous; for they so far resemble filters,
that are necessarily charged with the fluid before they permit it to pass out.
De La Beche has advanced the opinion that capillary attraction has great power,
both in mechanically disseminating water among rocks, and in retaining it in them
when so disseminated, and that it therefore keeps them, to a certain extent, saturated
with moisture, and assists in promoting a more equal flow of water in springs.
Capillary attraction and gravity probably carry water down far beyond those situations
where it can be returned in springs, at least cold springs, for there are certain
circumstances connected with those which are thermal, which go to prove, that the
water thrown up by them may have percolated to considerable depths. It is very
evident that most rocks contain disseminated moisture, for there are few which,
when exposed to heat, do not give water. Sulphate of lime, for example, or plaster
of paris, contains about 20 per cent., and common serpentine, as much as 15 per
cent. of it. Soap-stone has 4 per cent., and even quartz 2 per cent. of water, in
their composition. This fluid exists in minerals either as <i>water of crystallization</i>,
or combined as a <i>hydrate</i>.</p>

<p>But though water is thus generally diffused over the surface of the globe, yet
it is not found perfectly pure in any place; even the rain and the snow that descend
from the clouds, the condensation, as it were, of a natural distillation, are
slightly tainted by saline matters; which circumstance can only arise from the great
solvent power of water enabling it to take up a portion of most substances with
which it comes into contact, in its natural condition. In many lakes, and in the
ocean, the quantity of saline matter is so great as to render it unfit for diluent
purposes; but, when sea-water freezes, the saline impregnations are deposited;
and the ice affords fresh water. In the state in which water is generally employed
as a diluent, its impregnations are in small quantity, and not usually sufficient
either to dim its transparency, or to give it color, smell, or taste, and consequently
to render it unfit for the ordinary purposes of life. Water, therefore, which
is transparent, colorless, inodorous, and tasteless, is called <i>good</i> and <i>pure</i>, and
none other can be called such; though some medical writers are of opinion,
that it is not necessary it should be in this pure state for common use. Such
opinion however is undoubtedly <span class="locked">erroneous—</span></p>

<p>II. <i>In the organized kingdom.</i> Water enters largely into the composition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
organic substances. It constitutes, at least, four fifths of the weight of the animal
tissues, being the source of their physical properties, extensibility and flexibility.
This water is not chemically combined in them: for it is gradually given off by
evaporation, and can be extracted at once by strong pressure between blotting-paper.
When deprived of its water, animal matter becomes wholly insusceptible of vitality;
except in the case of some of the lower animals, which, as well as some plants,
revive when again moistened. According to Chevreul, pure water alone can reduce
organized substances to this state of softness; although salt water, alcohol, ether,
and oil, are also imbibed by dry animal textures. Moist animal tissues, by virtue of
their porosity, allow soluble matters, which come into contact with them, to be
dissolved by the water which they contain, and which oils their pores: if the matters
are already in solution, they are imparted by their solutions to the water of the
tissues. Gaseous substances are taken up in the same way. Water exists in nearly
as large a proportion in vegetable as in animal substances.</p>

<p><i>Properties.</i> Pure water, as has already been stated, is a transparent liquid without
color, taste, or smell. Some have doubted whether it is entirely inodorous,
from the fact that the camel, and some other animals, can scent water to a considerable
distance, and also whether it can be called colorless, as all large masses of
water have a bluish-green color. This phenomenon is, however, probably owing
to the presence of foreign matters. It refracts light powerfully, is a slow conductor
of heat, when its internal movements are prevented, and an imperfect conductor
of electricity. It is almost incompressible, a pressure equal to 2000 atmospheres
occasioning a diminution of only one-ninth of its bulk; or, when submitted to a
compressing force equal to 30,000 lbs. on the square inch, 14 volumes of this fluid
are condensed into 13 volumes; proving that it is elastic. Water being the substance
most easily procured in every part of the earth in a state of purity, it has
been chosen by universal consent, to represent the unit of the specific gravity of
all solid and liquid bodies. A cubic inch of water at 60° Fah. weighs 255.5 grains;
so that this fluid is about 815 times heavier than atmospheric air, but being the
standard to which the weight of all other substances is referred, its specific weight
is said to be 1. Accordingly when we say that the specific gravity of a body is
<i>two</i> we mean that it weighs twice as much as the same volume of water would
do. Water unites with both acids and bases, but without destroying their acid or
basic properties. Thus the crystallized vegetable acids, tartaric, citric, and oxalic,
are atomic combinations of water with acids. Caustic potash (potassa fusa) and
slaked lime may be instanced as compounds of water, and basic substances;
these are therefore called <i>hydrates</i>. The crystallized salts, such as alum, common
salt, sulphate of soda, sulphate of magnesia, borate of soda, (borax,) &amp;c., contain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
a large amount of water as a chemical constituent, called water of crystallization.
Water rapidly absorbs some gases, as ammonia, fluoride of boron, &amp;c., but it is
neither combustible, nor, under ordinary circumstances, a supporter of combustion.</p>

<p><i>Composition.</i> The composition of water is determined both by analysis and
synthesis. If this liquid be submitted to the influence of a volcanic battery, it is
decomposed into two gases, namely one volume of oxygen and two volumes of
hydrogen. These gases, in the proportions just mentioned, may be made to recombine,
and form water by heat, electricity, or spongy platinum, as water consists
of one equivalent of hydrogen, 1 and one of oxygen, 8 = 9; and in volume, of
one volume of hydrogen, and half a volume of oxygen, condensed into aqueous
vapor or steam we can easily calculate the specific gravity of steam, for its density
will be, .0689 (Sp. gr. of hydrogen) + .5512 (half the Sp. gr. of oxygen) = .6201.</p>

<h4><i>Water as affected by the laws of Heat.</i></h4>

<p>As the extensive and important functions which water discharges in the economy
of nature, depend mainly on the manner in which it is affected by the laws of heat,
a few remarks on this subject may not be inappropriate to this place.</p>

<p>Heat is communicated through water in a different manner, from that observed in
relation to solids, for it is not <i>conducted</i> as in them, from one particle to another,
but carried with the parts of the fluid by means of an intestine motion. Water expands
and becomes lighter by heat, and therefore it is, that if the upper portion of
water be cooled below the lower, the former descends, and the latter rises to take its
place. Thus a constant counter-current is kept up, and the whole body of water
has to cool down to near the freezing point, before congelation can take place.
This equalization of temperature, moreover, takes place much more rapidly, than it
would do in a solid body; hence alternations of heat and cold, as day and night,
summer and winter, produce in water, inequalities of temperature much smaller
than those which occur in a solid body.</p>

<p>Hence it is, that the ocean, which covers so large a portion of the earth’s surface,
produces the effect of making the alternations of heat and cold much less violent
than they would be if it were absent. The different temperatures of its upper and
lower parts produce a current which draws the seas, and by means of the seas, the
air, towards the mean temperature. This circulation is also carried on between distant
tracts of the ocean; as we see in the case of the Gulf Stream, which rushing
from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic to the western shores of Europe, carries
with it a portion of the heat of equatorial climes to the colder northern regions, and
bringing back in return a portion of the cold from the same higher latitudes. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
large portions of the earth are rendered habitable to man, which, without the existence
of such a law, would be doomed to perpetual frost and solitude. This influence
of the ocean on temperature, explains satisfactorily some peculiarities in the climates
of certain tracts and islands, for example, why London is cooler in summer, and
hotter in winter than Paris. But though water expands by heat and contracts by
cold, there is even a limit to this law, for had there not been, the lower parts of
water would have frozen first, and thus entire lakes, rivers and oceans, perhaps, become
solid, and had they become thus frozen, they would have remained so; for, as
the heat at the surface would not have descended far through the colder parts, the
main body of the ice must forever have remained solid, as in the arctic circle. To
obviate this great disadvantage, water contracts by the increase of cold till we come
<i>near</i> the freezing temperature, (40° F.) when it begins to expand and continues so
to do till it freezes; at 32° F. Hence, water at 40° is at its greatest density and
will lie at the bottom, with cooler water or ice floating above it. However much the
surface be cooled, water colder than 40° cannot descend to displace water warmer
than itself. Hence we never can have ice formed at the bottom of deep water,
though it is not uncommon to find it thus situated, in shallow streams or rivers of
rapid flow. Here the temperature of the whole body of water is brought down to
the freezing point, and in freezing the ice adheres to the sides and bottom of the
stream. What a beautiful provision is this, that the coldest water should rise to the
surface, and there freeze and remain, exposed to the warmth of the sun-beams and
the air, to be speedily dissolved upon the return of spring! This is owing to the
well known fact, that in the act of freezing a still further expansion takes place, so
that the specific gravity of ice is less than water of any temperature, and consequently
floats upon the surface. We thus see that by the contraction of water by
cold, the temperature of various times and places is equalized, though were that
contraction without limit, a great portion of the earth would be bound in fetters of
ice. Such a disastrous result, is prevented by the substitution of expansion for contraction,
when the temperature is reduced to 40°, and the benevolent purposes of an
all-wise Designer, are made still more manifest by the further expansion of water in
the act of freezing. As water becomes ice by cold, it becomes <i>steam</i> by heat. We
generally understand by steam the vapor of hot water, but steam or vapor rises from
water at all temperatures, however low, and even from ice. The expansive force of
this vapor increases rapidly as the heat increases, but yet in all cases the surface of
water is covered with an atmosphere of aqueous vapor, the pressure, or <i>tension</i> of
which is limited by the temperature of the water. If, therefore, the vapor is not
confined, causing the surface of water to be pressed upon, evaporation will take
place, and thus there must, according to this law, always exist an atmosphere of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
aqueous vapor, the tension of which may be compared with that of our common
atmosphere. Now the pressure of the latter is measured by the barometrical column,
about 30 inches of mercury, while that of watery vapor is equal to one inch of mercury
at the constituent temperature of 80 degrees, and to one fifth of an inch at the
temperature of 32 degrees.</p>

<p>If the atmosphere of air by which we are supported were annihilated, there
would still remain, an atmosphere of aqueous vapor, arising from the waters and
moist parts of the earth, but in the existing state of things this vapor rises <i>in</i> the
atmosphere of dry air, and thus its distribution and effects are materially influenced
by the vehicle in which it is thus carried.</p>

<p>The moisture thus floating at all times in the air, serves for the support of vegetable
life, even in countries where rain seldom if ever falls. It is absorbed by
the leaves of living plants, which thus increase in weight even when suspended in
the atmosphere and disconnected with the soil. During intense heats, and when the
soil is parched and dry, we see the life of plants thus preserved until the earth is
again refreshed with showers, and the roots supplied with their wonted moisture.</p>

<p><i>Clouds</i>, are produced when aqueous vapor returns to the state of water; and
this process is called <i>condensation</i>. Whenever the temperature becomes lower than
the constituent temperature, requisite for the maintenance of the vapory state, some
of the vapor, or invisible steam, will be condensed, and become water. This
may be seen illustrated in the condensation of the steam, as it issues from the
spout of a tea-kettle. Clouds not only moderate the fervor of the sun, but they
also check radiation from the earth, for we find that the coldest nights are those
which occur under a cloudless winter sky. The use of clouds in the formation
of rain, is too obvious to need pointing out more particularly. <i>Snow</i> is frozen
vapour aggregated by a confused action of crystalline laws, and <i>ice</i> is water, solidified
while in its fluid state, by the same crystalline forces. These are bad conductors
of cold, and when the ground is covered with snow, or the surface of
the soil, or if the water is frozen, the roots or bulbs of plants beneath are
protected by the congealed water from the influence of the atmosphere, the
temperature of which in northern winters, is usually very much below the freezing
point; and this water becomes the first nourishment of the plant, in early spring.
The expansion of water during its congelation, at which time its volume increases
one twelfth, and its contraction in bulk during a thaw, tend to pulverize the soil, to
separate its parts from each other, and to make it more permeable to the influence
of the air.</p>

<p>When ice changes to water, or water to steam, although at an invariable degree of
temperature, yet the change is not sudden, but gradual. When the heat reaches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the point, at which thawing or boiling takes place, the temperature makes a
stand; a portion of it disappears, or becomes <i>latent</i>, as it is called; thus the
temperature of ice cannot be raised, till the whole is thawed, nor that of boiling
water, till it has all been converted into steam; all the heat that is applied being
absorbed in producing these changes. Were it not for this law of latent heat,
thaw and evaporation would be instantaneous, we should be overwhelmed with
floods, at the first glow of warmth in the spring, and in heating water the whole
would flash instantaneously into steam upon reaching the boiling point.</p>

<p>It is through the same relations of water to heat, that springs are supplied—for
these undoubtedly draw their principal supplies from rain. Mr. Dalton has calculated
that the quantity of rain which falls in England is 36 inches a year. Of this
he reckoned that 13 inches flow off to the sea by the rivers, and that the remaining
23 inches are raised again from the ground by evaporation. The 13 inches of
water are of course supplied by evaporation from the sea, and are carried back to
the land through the atmosphere. Vapor is perpetually rising from the ocean, and
is condensed by cold in the hills and high lands, as is easily recognized by the mists
and rains, which are frequent in such regions; whence it descends through their
pores and crevices, till it is deflected, collected and conducted out to the sea, by
some stratum or channel which is water-tight, thus keeping up a perpetual and
compound circulation. In every country these two portions of the aqueous circulation
have their regular and nearly constant proportion; and their due distribution
appears to be necessary to its organic health, to the habits of vegetables and of man.
This circulation goes on from year to year as regularly as that of the blood, in the
veins and arteries of the human system, and though maintained by a very different
machinery, is no less clearly adapted to its purposes. In short the properties of
water which regard heat make one vast watering engine of the atmosphere, (<i>Whewell</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Water.</span> Under this head are included the waters commonly known
as <i>rain</i>, <i>spring</i>, <i>river</i>, <i>well</i> or <i>pump</i>, <i>lake</i> and <i>marsh waters</i>. Thomson includes
<i>ice</i>, and <i>snow water</i>, <i>spring</i> and <i>river water</i>, and <i>lake water</i> under <i>rain water</i>, as it
is from this source that they are chiefly supplied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rain Water</span> is the purest kind of all natural waters, though subject to some
variations. Thus, when collected in large towns or cities, it is less pure than when
obtained in the country; moreover it is usually loaded with impurities at the commencement
of a shower, but after some hours of continuous rain it becomes nearly
pure; for the first water which falls brings down the various foreign matters suspended
in the atmosphere. In specific gravity, it scarcely differs from distilled water.
It nevertheless generally holds in solution common air, carbonic acid, carbonate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
lime, chloride of lime, and a trace of nitric acid. If it be collected from the roofs
of houses, after it has rained for some time, it contains sulphate of lime and occasionally
carbonate of lead. The quantity of common air in rain water does not exceed
3½ cubic inches in 100 cubic inches of water; it contains more oxygen than
atmospherical air; the same quantity of rain water contains one inch of carbonic
acid gas.</p>

<p>These combinations, in the small quantities in which they exist, in no degree injure
the diluent properties of rain water. It is indeed to the presence of the two
elastic gases, that rain water owes the taste which renders it palatable to animals
and useful to vegetables. Ice water, being destitute of these gases is extremely
vapid; fish cannot live in it; and it does not seem either to quench thirst or to be
so complete a solvent in the stomach as rain water. Carbonate of ammonia is also
another ingredient. It is derived from the putrefaction of nitrogenous substances.
When several hundred pounds of rain water were distilled by Liebig, in a copper
still, and the first two or three pounds evaporated with the addition of a little muriatic
acid, he found a very distinct crystallization of sal-ammoniac, the crystals having
a brown or yellow color. “It is worthy of observation,” says Liebig, “that the
ammonia contained in rain and snow water possesses an offensive smell of perspiration
and animal excrements, a fact which leaves no doubt respecting its origin.”
It is owing to the presence of carbonate of ammonia that rain water owes its <i>softer</i>
feel than pure distilled water. According to Liebig, it is the atmospheric ammonia
which furnishes the nitrogen of plants. The traces of nitric acid which have been
detected in the air, are referable to the oxidation of the constituents of ammonia;
and not to the direct union of the oxygen and free nitrogen of the atmosphere. Dr.
Pereira states that a carbonaceous (sooty) substance, and traces of sulphates, chlorides,
and calcareous matter, are the usual impurities of the first rain water of a
shower. Zimmerman found oxide of iron and chloride potassium in rain water;
other chemists have been able to detect no iron in it, but have found meteoric iron
and nickel in dew. Brande detected in it, chloride of sodium, chloride of magnesium,
sulphate and carbonate of magnesium, sulphate of lime, and oxide of manganese.
The putrefaction to which rain water is subject, shows that some organic
matter is present. The term <i>pyrrhin</i> (from πυρρος red) has been applied by Zimmerman
to an atmospheric organic substance which reddens solutions of silver.
Whenever rain water is collected near large towns, it should be boiled and strained
before use, as it contains less saline impregnation than other kinds of natural waters,
it is more apt to become contaminated with lead from roofs, gutters, cisterns, and
water pipes. To purify rain water and render it useful, for the delicate purposes of
chemical experiment, Morveau recommends dropping into it a little barytic water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and then exposing it for some time to the atmospheric air. This combines with the
carbonic acid, which being the solvent of the carbonate of lime, both it and the carbonate
of baryta are precipitated as insoluble salts. Instead of exposing it to the
atmosphere, it may be poured from one vessel to another; by which means not
only the minute portion of barytic water is dispersed through the rain water, and
brought into contact with the carbonic acid, but it involves a great portion of air in
its substance, which improves both the taste and the utility of the fluid.</p>

<p><i>Snow water</i>, as we have already stated, is destitute of air and other gaseous
matters found in rain. According to Liebig, it contains ammonia. It has long
been a popular, but erroneous opinion, that it was injurious to health, and had a
tendency to produce bronchocele. But this malady occurs at Sumatra, where ice
and snow are never seen; while, on the contrary, the disease is quite unknown in
Chili and Thibet, although the rivers of these countries are chiefly supplied by the
melting of the snow, with which the mountains are covered. Ice is said not to
quench thirst, but on the contrary to augment it, and that the natives of the Arctic
regions prefer enduring the utmost extremity of this feeling, rather than attempt to
remove it by eating of snow,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> (<i>Captain Ross</i>.)</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Spring Water.</span> Rain water, when it falls on high grounds, enters the soil
and filtrates through it, until it is stopped by some natural obstacle, when it pushes
upwards, and welling out upon the surface, forms springs; the water is therefore
merely a modification of rain water. During its passage, however, it almost always
takes up some soluble matters, which of course vary according to the nature of the
soil. It is purest when it passes through sand or gravel; in a limestone region, it
always contains more or less of the sulphate and carbonate of lime, and it generally
contains a trace of common salt, and the usual proportions of air and carbonic acid
gas. The presence of these is detected by subacetate of lead, which displays the
smallest portion of carbonic acid or a carbonate, and nitrate of silver, which detects
the muriates by the formation of muriate of silver.</p>

<p>Water from melted <i>ice</i> is perfectly wholesome, and is drunk during the summer
season, wherever the climate will admit of its being collected and preserved at a
moderate expense. In this form, it is a luxury—almost a <i>necessary</i>—in the middle
states of this country more particularly, “where,” Dr. Dunglison remarks, “there
is not a tavern on the road, on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, that does not
furnish ice to the traveller in any abundance.” When sea-water freezes, the ice does
not contain the salts. Consequently, when melted, it affords fresh water, and according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
to the voyagers in high northern and southern latitudes, the water has been
found sweet, soft, and wholesome.</p>

<p><i>River Water.</i> This is a mixture of rain and spring water, and when deprived
of the matters which it frequently holds in suspension, is generally of considerable
purity. Mountain streams, which generally issue from siliceous rocks, and
run over stony or pebbly beds, are, for the most part, comparatively pure and
soft. The river water of New-England, and the other hilly portions of the United
States, is usually of this description, though in the time of floods, and after heavy
rains, they contain much sedimentary matter. River water gradually deposits
much of its earthy salts as it flows, and becomes purer by exposure; it therefore
generally contains less calcareous matter than spring water; its specific
gravity is less, and its taste more vapid. It, however, more or less partakes of
the nature of the soil over which it flows; consequently some rivers, whose
waters were pure and excellent at their source, lose these properties before they
mingle with the sea. The water of the Thames, for example, in England,
which is originally very soft and pure, becomes so loaded with animal and vegetable
matter from the towns and villages on its banks, that after being kept a
month or two in a closed cask, on opening it, a quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, of the most offensive odor escapes, and the water is so black and nauseous
as to be unfit for use. But on racking it off, it clears, depositing a quantity
of slimy mud, and becomes remarkably clear, sweet and palatable. As the
matters deposited in such rivers are merely mingled with the body of the water,
which is too large, and too changing, to admit of any permanent taint from
solution, filtration, or even the natural deposition of the ingredients fits them
for every domestic and medicinal purpose.</p>

<p>The Croton water was taken from the Croton dam, and when perfectly clear
was found, as appears by the above analysis to contain 4.998, or about <i>five</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
grains of solid matter to the gallon. The Schuylkill water was taken from the
middle basin on Fair Mount, and contained 4.08 grains of solid matter to the
gallon. The Croton differs from the Schuylkill water in containing a larger
amount of the alkaline carbonates, and of the carbonate of magnesia, while
it contains less carbonate of lime, and is entirely destitute of the alkaline
sulphates, of which the Schuylkill contains 13.74 parts in 100 of the total
solid matters, though amounting to only one half a grain to the gallon.</p>

<p>It appears from the above table, that the amount of impurities contained in the
Thames water, exceeds those of the Croton by nearly six fold, and that the quantity
of lime, held in solution in the former, surpasses that of the latter, about fifteen
times. The Thames water differs also from the Croton, in the circumstance that it
contains an appreciable quantity of chloride of sodium, or common salt of which the
Croton is entirely free. There are but very few streams to be found, whose waters
contain less than 4.16 grains of solid matter to the gallon. The carbonate of lime
is held in solution by carbonic acid, forming bicarbonate of lime. By boiling, this
acid is expelled, and the carbonate of lime is precipitated on the sides of the vessel,
constituting the <i>fur</i> of the tea-kettle, and the <i>crust</i> of boilers. River water always
contains a quarter or less quantity of organic matter in suspension or solution. As
a general rule, the quantity is too small to produce any decidedly injurious effect,
but physicians and medical writers agree in the opinion that water impregnated with
it to any great extent must be deleterious. Where the quantity of decomposing
matter is too small to produce any immediately obvious effects, it is difficult to procure
any decisive evidence of its influence on the system. When the amount is considerable,
it causes dysentery and fevers, often of a highly fatal character. In a trial
at Nottingham, England, in 1836, it was proved that dysentery of an aggravated
form, was caused in cattle by the use of water contaminated with putrescent vegetable
matter, produced by the refuse of a starch manufactory. The fish, (perch,
pike, roach, dace, &amp;c.,) and frogs in the pond, through which the brook ran, were
destroyed, and all the animals which drank of the water became seriously ill, and
many of them died with the symptoms of dysentery. It was, moreover, shown, that
the animals sometimes refused to drink the water, that the mortality was in proportion
to the quantity of starch made at different times; and that subsequently, when
the putrescent matter was not allowed to pass into the brook, but was conveyed to
a river at some distance, the fish and frogs began to return, and the mortality ceased
among the cattle. There are many instances on record where troops have sickened
and many died of putrid fever and dysentery, from drinking the water of stagnant
pools and ditches or of rivers, as of the river Lee, near Cork, (Ireland,) which, in
passing through the city, receives the contents of the sewers from the houses, and is
otherwise unwholesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>The organic matter contained in river water consists chiefly of the exuviæ of
animal and vegetable substances, but another class of impurities consists of living
beings, (animals and vegetables.) The aquatic animals, which have, from time to
time, been exhibited in this city by means of the solar microscope, are collected in
stagnant pools, and are not found in river or well water. The quantity of organic
matter contained in the Croton must be extremely small, as this, together with the
silex, iron, and magnesia, amount to only 4/10ths of one grain to the gallon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well Water</span>,—or <i>pump</i> water, as it is often called in cities, is essentially the
same as spring water, but liable to impregnation, owing to the land springs filtering
through the walls, and conveying impurities into it. This is sometimes prevented
by lining them with cast-iron cylinders, or by bricks laid in water-cement. Dr.
Percival affirms, that bricks harden the softest water, and give it an aluminous impregnation.
The old wells must, therefore, furnish much purer water than the more
recent, as the soluble particles are gradually washed away. It contains a greater
proportion of earthy salts, and of air, and has a greater specific gravity than other
spring waters. Owing to the fact, that it contains a larger quantity of bicarbonate
and sulphate of lime, than river water, it decomposes and curdles soap, and is then
denominated <i>hard water</i>, to distinguish it from those waters which mix with soap,
and are therefore called <i>soft waters</i>. The reason that hard water does not form a
pure opaline solution with soap, is, because the lime of the calcareous salts, chiefly
the <i>sulphate</i>, forms an insoluble compound with the margaric and oleic acids of the
soap. Here a double decomposition ensues, the sulphuric acid unites with the alkali
of the soap, setting free the fatty acids, which unite with the lime to form an insoluble
earthy soap. Hard water is a less perfect solvent of organic matter than soft
water; hence in the preparation of infusions and decoctions, and for many economical
purposes, as making tea and coffee, and brewing, it is much inferior to soft
water, and for the same reasons it is improper as a drink in dyspeptic affections,
causing irritation, and a sensation of weight in the stomach. The abundance of
this earthy salt in the water of Paris, and London, of many parts of Switzerland
and this country, cause uncomfortable feelings in strangers who visit these places.
It is also said to produce calculous complaints in the inhabitants, a result which
might be expected, owing to the low solvent power of the water not being sufficient
to carry off the animal acid, which concretes in the kidneys to form calculi.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
water can be easily freed from these earthy salts; boiling precipitates the carbonate
of lime by driving off the carbonic acid which holds it in solution; and the addition
of a little carbonate of soda precipitates the lime, if any exist in the water. Many
persons prefer the taste of hard water to that of soft, and a change from one to the
other, frequently causes a derangement of the digestive organs. The briskness, and
rapidity of this and other water is owing to the air, and carbonic acid mixed with it.
The air contained in water, has a larger proportion of oxygen than atmospheric air,
and hence it is better adapted for the respiration of animals.</p>

<p>The water procured from wells in the city of New-York, has gradually been
growing more and more impure, as the city has increased in size, until a very large
proportion of it, is entirely unfit for culinary and dietetic purposes. That in the
lower part of the city, has always been, more or less, brackish, owing to the percolation
of the salt water from the north and east rivers through the loose sandy soil,
thus giving them a distinct saline impregnation. The amount of impurities contained
in these waters, varies, therefore, in different parts of the city, according to its
elevation, and the denseness of the population. A gallon of water from the well
belonging to the Manhattan Company in Reade-street, yielded 125 grains of solid
matter; while the same quantity of water, from their well in Bleecker-street, yielded
20 grains, and in 13th street, 14 grains. A gallon of water taken from four of the
city wells in the densely populated parts of the city yielded on an average, 58 grains
each of solid matter.</p>

<p>The supply also of well water has been gradually diminishing in this city for the
last several years. For example, at the Chemical Works on the North River, at
33d street, and at an extensive distillery on the East River, some distance above
the Alms House, water cannot be procured in sufficient quantities on their premises,
where, but a few years past, it was obtained in great abundance. At the Gas Works
on the Collect grounds, where they have a well 20 feet in depth, by 18 feet in diameter,
which, until 1834, furnished water freely, enabling the engine to raise 20,000
gallons in ten hours, in 1835 it required 14 to 16 hours to raise the same quantity,
and in order to continue the supply, it was found necessary to return the water to
the well, after using it for condensing the gas. The Corporation well, also, in 13th
street, furnished, for several years, about 120,000 gallons of water daily, but in 1835,
this quantity was reduced down to from five to ten thousand. In order to remedy
this evil, a well was sunk at Jefferson Market, which in a short time deprived most
of the wells in that vicinity, of water; thus drying up one source of supply, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
to increase that of another. There is, therefore, every probability that had not water
been introduced into the city of New-York from abroad, the supply from the wells
would, in a few years, have been insufficient for the economical, domestic and manufacturing
purposes of the inhabitants. It is fearful to contemplate the amount of
decomposing organic matter contained in the wells in the vicinity of Trinity, St.
Paul’s, and St. John’s burying grounds, which for more than a century furnished
the only water used by those residing in their neighborhood. No one can doubt
that the use of such water, as well as that from the wells on the Collect, and over
the greater portion of the city below Canal-street, must have proved extremely detrimental
to the health of the citizens, and especially to children, and infants. We
believe, therefore that the introduction of the Croton water, will increase the average
duration of human life in the city of New-York, from 8 to 12 per cent. From 1815
to 1836, it ranged from 30.08 to 22.05, (in 1836), but the mean duration of life for
the last 20 years is about 25 years; and the ratio of mortality, according to population,
about as 1 to 35. From the manner, however, in which the inspector’s reports
have been made, from the imperfection of the law, no great confidence can be placed
in the returns,—those carried out of the city for burial, not having been included.</p>

<p>From a “Report on the subject of introducing pure and wholesome water into
the city of Boston, by L. Baldwin, Esq., Civil Engineer,” it appears that the whole
number of wells in that city in 1835, was 2,767. The water from 2,085 of these
wells was drinkable, though brackish and hard, and 682 of them were bad and
unfit for use. There were only seven of the city wells which yielded soft water
occasionally and for washing, and from 33 of them the water was obtained by deep
boring. “Within a few years,” says the Report, “it has become common in
Boston, and the vicinity, to bore for water, and to make what are called Artesian
wells. But no certain or valuable result has grown out of these endeavors.
There are 33 bored wells, only two of which are stated as furnishing soft water.
The same remarks will apply to the public wells of this city, the most of which
produce nothing but hard and brackish water, and none of which is sufficiently
soft to authorize its use in washing clothes,” &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lake Water</span> is a collection of rain, spring and river water, usually more
or less contaminated with putrefying organic matter. It is generally <i>soft</i>, and
when filtered, is as good and wholesome as any other description of waters.
Though lake water cannot be characterized as having any invariable qualities;
yet most of the Lakes of the United States, especially our great ones, afford
a very pure water. In many of our smaller lakes the water is more or less stagnant,
and of course very unhealthy.</p>

<p><i>Marsh Water.</i> This is analogous to lake water, except that it is altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
stagnant and is more loaded with putrescent matter. The sulphates in sea and
other waters are decomposed by putrefying vegetable matter, with the evolution
of sulphuretted hydrogen; hence the intolerable stench from marshy and swampy
grounds liable to occasional inundations from the sea. Marsh water cannot
be drunk with safety either by man or beast.</p>

<h4><i>Tests of the usual impurities in Common Water.</i></h4>

<p>The following are the tests by which the presence of the ordinary constituents
or impurities of common waters may be ascertained.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Ebullition.</span>—By boiling, air and carbonic acid gas are expelled, while
carbonate of lime, (which has been held in solution by the carbonic acid) is
deposited. The latter constitutes the crust which lines tea-kettles and boilers.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Protosulphate of Iron.</span> If a crystal of this salt be introduced into
a phial filled with the water to be examined, and the phial be well corked, a
yellowish-brown precipitate (sesquioxide of iron) will be deposited in a few days,
if oxygen gas be contained in the water.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Litmus.</span> Infusion of litmus or syrup of violets is reddened by a free acid.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Lime Water.</span> This is a test for carbonic acid, with which it causes a white
precipitate (carbonate of lime) if employed before the water is boiled.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Chloride of Barium.</span> A solution of this salt usually yields, with well
water, a white precipitate insoluble in nitric acid. This indicates the presence
of sulphuric acid (which, in common water, is combined with lime).</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Oxalate of Ammonia.</span> If this salt yield a white precipitate, it indicates
the presence of lime, (carbonate and sulphate.)</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Nitrate of Silver.</span> If this occasion a precipitate insoluble in nitric acid,
the presence of chlorine may be inferred.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Phosphate of Soda.</span> If the lime contained in common water be removed
by ebullition and oxalic acid, and to the strained and transparent water, ammonia
and phosphate of soda be added, any magnesia present will, in the course
of a few hours, be precipitated in the form of the white ammoniacal phosphate
of magnesia.</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Tincture of Galls.</span> This is used as a test for Iron, with solutions of
which it forms an inky liquor, (tannate and gallate of iron). If the test produce
this effect on the water before, but not after boiling, the iron is in the state
of carbonate; if after, as well as before, in that of sulphate. Tea may be substituted
for galls, to which its effects and indications are similar. <i>Ferro cyanide
of potassium</i> yields, with solutions of the sesqui-salts of iron, a blue precipitate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and with the proto-salts a white precipitate, which becomes blue by exposure to
the air.</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Hydrosulphuric Acid.</span> (<i>Sulphuretted Hydrogen.</i>) This yields a dark
(brown or black) precipitate, (a metallic sulphuret) with water containing iron or
lead in solution.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Evaporation and Ignition.</span> If the water be evaporated to dryness, and
ignited in a glass tube, the presence of organic matter may be inferred by the odor
and smoke evolved, as well as by the charring. Another mode of detecting organic
matter is by adding nitrate (or acetate) of lead to the inspected water, and collecting
and igniting the precipitate; when globules of metallic lead are obtained if organic
matter be present. The putrefaction of water is another proof of the presence of
this matter. Nitrate of silver is the best test for the presence of chloride of soda or
common salt. By adding a small quantity of this to the common well water of
New-York, a copious, white, flocculent precipitate is immediately formed, which is
the chloride of soda. The same test, however, applied to the Croton water, produces
no discoloration whatever.</p>

<p><i>Purification of Common water.</i> By <i>filtration</i>, water may be deprived of living
beings and of all suspended impurities; but substances held in solution, cannot
thus be separated. <i>Ebullition</i> destroys the vitality of both animals and vegetables;
expels air, or carbonic acid, and causes the precipitation of carbonate of lime, but
the water should be afterwards subjected to the process of <i>filtration</i>. <i>Distillation</i>,
when properly conducted is the most effectual method of purifying water. But distilled
water is in general contaminated by traces of organic matter. The addition
of chemical agents is another mode which has been proposed and practised, for
freeing water from some of its impurities. <i>Alum</i> is often used by the common people
to cleanse muddy water, and ashes and pearl-ash to destroy its hardness. When
alum is used, two or three grains are sufficient for a quart of water. The alum decomposes
the carbonate of lime; sulphate of lime is formed in solution, and the
alumina precipitates in flocks, carrying with it mechanical impurities. This agent,
however, adds nothing to the chemical purity of the water, but by converting the
carbonate into sulphate of lime augments its hardness. <i>Caustic alkalies</i> added to
lime saturate the excess of carbonic acid, and throw down the carbonate of lime,
having an alkaline carbonate in solution. Professor Clark of Aberdeen,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> (Scotland)
has recently patented a plan for the purification of water, by the addition of
lime. The lime unites with the excess of carbonic acid in the water, and forms
carbonate of lime (chalk) which precipitates, along with the carbonate of lime held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
previously in solution in the water. The effect of this process is similar to that of
ebullition,—as the hardness of water is, however, owing to the sulphate and not the
carbonate of lime,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> this plan can have little or no influence in rendering hard water
soft. Alkaline carbonates soften water, decompose all the earthy salts (calcareous
and magnesian carbonates, sulphates, and chlorides) and precipitate the earthy matters.
They leave, however, in solution, an alkaline salt, but which does not communicate
to water the property of hardness.</p>

<p><i>Action of Water on Lead.</i> When lead is exposed to atmospheric air, the oxygen
of the air combining with it, forms an oxide, while, at the same time the carbonic
acid of the air, unites with it forming a thin white crust, which is the <i>carbonate of
lead</i>. This formation is accelerated by moisture, and by the presence of an unusual
quantity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere. The same process goes on with still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
greater rapidity in pure running water. But if water be deprived of all its gases by
ebullition, and excluded from contact with the air, the lead will not be acted upon
If water, however, be exposed to the air, although all the gases have been expelled,
a white powder will soon form around the lead, till, in the course of a few days, there
is formed a large quantity of white, pearly scales, which partly float in the water,
but are chiefly deposited on the bottom of the vessel. In 12 ounces of distilled
water, contained in a shallow glass basin, loosely covered to exclude the dust, twelve
brightly polished lead rods weighing 340 grains, will lose 2½ grains in 8 days, and
the lead will show evident marks of corrosion; and this action will go on as long as
the water is exposed to the air. While these changes are going on, a small quantity
of lead will be dissolved, as may be shown by carefully filtering the water acidulating
with a drop or two of nitric acid, and evaporating to dryness. Sulphuretted hydrogen
is also a good test, occasioning, where lead is present, first a brown color, and
subsequently a black precipitate. Christison has proved that the lead which is dissolved,
is in the form of the carbonate, and hydrate of the oxide, or, oxide of lead,
carbonic acid and water.</p>

<p>The fact is then sufficiently established, that distilled water has the property of
dissolving lead—Does the same hold true in relation to waters in ordinary use? In
the year 1809, it was first announced by <i>Guyton Morveau</i>, that the salts which are
held in solution by some natural waters, destroy their property of acting on lead, and
that of these modifying circumstances none are more remarkable in their action
than the neutral salts. Dr. Christison has pursued this investigation with great success,
and has proved that this preservative power exists in the case of sulphates,
muriates, carbonates, hydriodates, phosphates, nitrates, acetates, tartrates, arseniates,
&amp;c. These salts, however, do not possess an equally protective influence, the
carbonates and sulphates being most, the chlorides the least energetic of those saline
substances commonly met with in waters. As a general rule, it appears that those
whose acid forms with the lead a soluble salt of lead, are the least energetic; while
those whose acid forms an insoluble salt of lead, are most energetic. The variable
quantity of salts necessary to prevent the action of water on lead, may be seen from
the following results obtained by actual experiment.</p>

<p>The sulphates of soda, magnesia, lime, and the triple sulphate of alumina and
potash, possess about the same preservative power; which appears to depend on
the acid, not on the base of the salt. The general results of Dr. Christison’s investigations,
appear to be, that neutral salts in various, and for the most part minute,
proportions, retard or prevent the corrosive action of water on lead—allowing the
carbonate to deposit itself slowly, and to adhere with such firmness to the lead as
not to be afterwards removed by moderate agitation,—adding subsequently to this
crust other insoluble salts of lead, the acids of which are derived from the neutral
salts in solution,—and thus at length forming a permanent and impermeable screen
in the form of a film over its surface, through which the action of the water cannot
any longer be carried on. These films are composed of the carbonate of lead, with
a little of the muriate, sulphate, arseniate, or phosphate of lead, according to the
nature of the acid in the alkaline salt, which is dissolved in the water. The following
general conclusions may therefore be considered as sufficiently established.</p>

<p>1. Lead pipes ought not to be used for the purpose of conducting water, at least
where the distance is considerable, without a careful examination of the water to be
transmitted.</p>

<p>2. The risk of a dangerous impregnation with lead is greatest in the instance of
the purest waters.</p>

<p>3. Water, which tarnishes polished lead when left at rest upon it in a glass vessel
for a few hours, cannot safely be transmitted through lead-pipes without certain
precautions; and conversely, it is probable, that if lead remain untarnished, or
nearly so, for 24 hours in a glass of water, the water may be safely conducted
through lead-pipes.</p>

<p>4. Water which contains less than about an 8000th of salts in solution, can
not be safely conducted in lead pipes without certain precautions.</p>

<p>5. Even this proportion will prove insufficient to prevent corrosion, unless a
considerable part of the saline matter consists of carbonates and sulphates, especially
the former.</p>

<p>6. So large a proportion as a 4000th part, probably even a considerably larger
proportion, will be insufficient, if the salts in solution be in a great measure
muriates.</p>

<p>7. In all cases careful examination should be made of the water after
it has been running a few days through the pipes; for it is not improbable
that other circumstances, besides those hitherto ascertained, may regulate the
preventive influence of the neutral salts.</p>

<p>8. Where the water is of sufficient purity to act on lead, a remedy may be
found, either, in leaving the pipes full of water and at rest for three or four months,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
or by solution of phosphate of soda; in the proportion of about a 25,600th
part.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Dr. Kane, however, seems to differ from Dr. Christison in opinion on this
subject; for after having mentioned the crust which gradually forms on the
interior of the cistern, and assists in protecting it from the oxidizing action
of the air, he remarks, “no danger is therefore to be apprehended from the
supply of water to a city being conveyed through leaden pipes, and preserved in
leaden cisterns; for <i>all water of mineral origin dissolves, in filtering through
the layers of rocks in its passage to the surface</i>, a sufficiency of saline matters
to serve for its protection.”</p>

<p>Now, to apply these results to the water of the Croton; as this holds in solution
only about one 18,000th part of salts, it must, according to Christison, exert a
corroding influence on the lead-pipes. Dr. Dana, of Lowell, has lately investigated
this subject and detected lead in the water which had passed through the leaden-pipes
for the distribution of water in the city of Lowell. The first examination
was made from a sample of water taken from the source or spring-head before it had
entered the leaden pipes, when the specific gravity was found to be 1,000,18. The
pint, on evaporation to dryness, yielded 2.37 grains of solid matter. The solid
contents of an imperial pint were found to be,</p>

<p>It therefore has been calculated that every gallon of the water used after passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
through the leaden pipes, contains 1.312 grains of the carbonate of lead.
Such water, although it would not speedily destroy life, would undoubtedly be
attended with injurious consequences, should its use be habitually continued.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Dr. Hare of Philadelphia, in reply to a letter requesting
his opinion as to the action of the Schuylkill water<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> on lead pipes, states that after
using the Schuylkill water for 25 years in his laboratory, he has never perceived
the slightest indication of the presence of lead; and that if there had been any in
the water, the re-agents which he has been accustomed to use must have rendered
the impurity evident. If it be true that the Schuylkill water does not act upon
the lead pipes, it would follow as a matter of course, if the doctrines above laid
down be correct, that the Croton, which contains very nearly the same quantity
of saline ingredients, would also exert no influence upon this metal. In cases,
however, where injurious consequences have resulted from the agency of lead,
the pipes through which the water was conducted, were of considerable length;
suppose for example that the pipes are 4000 feet long, and three fourths of an inch
in diameter, each portion of water will pass successively over no less than 784
square feet of lead before being discharged; and it would not therefore be at
all remarkable, if the water were found contaminated with the lead. In this city,
however, the pipes are rarely more than 50 feet in length, generally not more
than 25, and therefore cannot exert so deleterious an influence as in those of greater
extent. Dr. Chilton, recently inspected the Croton water drawn from the leaden
pipes, by which it is introduced into the house of Mr. G. D. Coggeshall. No 421
Pearl-street in this city, and found the water evidently affected by the lead. He
has also obtained similar results in several other instances. If the precaution be used,
of not employing the water first drawn from the pipes for dietetic and culinary purposes,
no injurious consequences would probably attend the use of water conveyed
in this metal, but as this is not likely to be attended to generally, it is expedient
to employ other measures to guard against its deleterious effects.</p>

<p>For this purpose, various means have been suggested, such as the substitution
of block-tin and other metals not acted upon by water; but the most efficient, scientific,
and useful, as well as the most economical, of all the plans hitherto proposed,
is that introduced by Thomas Ewbank, Esq., of coating the lead-pipes with tin
both inside and out. The process, which has been patented, consists simply in
drawing an ordinary lead-pipe through a bath of melted tin, coated with a layer of
melted rosin, which leaves a continuous deposit, of tin upon both sides of the pipe,
of sufficient thickness, to effectually prevent any oxidation of the lead. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
pipes have been highly recommended by our first chemists, and other men of science,
as furnishing an effectual safeguard against the corroding effects of pure water
This highly ingenious process, strengthens the pipe, without diminishing its elasticity,
and although some small portions of the lead should escape being coated, yet
the proximity of the tin, will, from galvanic action, probably prevent oxidization of
the lead. As these pipes are furnished at about eight cents per pound, the usual
price of ordinary lead-pipe, there can be no doubt that they will be generally adopted
by our citizens,—as they have been, already, by the Corporation, in the conveyance
of the Croton water, into the public buildings.</p>

<p><i>Use of Water as Aliment.</i> Water is the beverage provided by nature for all animated
beings. It is a vital stimulus, or one of the external conditions essential for
the manifestations of life. Consequently, without it, life, at least in the higher order
of animals, could not be maintained.</p>

<p>Considered in a dietetical point of view, water serves three important purposes in
the animal economy; namely, it repairs the loss of the aqueous part of the blood,
caused by the action of the secreting and exhaling organs; secondly, it is a solvent
of various alimentary substances, and therefore assists the stomach in the act of digestion,
though, if taken in very large quantities, it may have an opposite effect, by
diluting the gastric juice; thirdly, it is a nutritive agent, that is, it assists in the
formation of the solid parts of the body.</p>

<p><i>As a diluent</i>, water is indispensable to the preservation of health. The body being
composed of solids and fluids, there must be maintained a certain relative proportion
of these, to constitute that state of system called health. In a full grown adult, the
solid matter of the body, by which we mean all that substantial part of the frame
which is not in constant motion in the vessels, amounts to only about one fifth of
the weight of the body—Chaussier says, one ninth of the total weight, the difference,
perhaps, being owing to the fact that there is a quantity of fluid combined with the
solids in so intimate a manner, as almost to constitute a part of their substance.
The diminution of the fluid part of the body, is the cause of an uneasy sensation,
indicating the necessity of repairing the waste of fluids, which we familiarly call
<i>thirst</i>. This is a sensation connected with some natural state of the corporeal functions,
and altogether independent of the occasional excitement of foreign bodies,
although it may be induced by these. There is a demand for a certain supply of
liquid which is the result of repletion of the stomach, and the cause of our drinking
at our ordinary meals, but this is different from true or spontaneous thirst. True
thirst occurs, when we have been some time without taking drink, (unless the food
has consisted mainly of fruits and other succulent vegetables; under which circumstances,
a person may go for months without any desire for drink); when the system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
has been greatly excited, whether by corporeal or mental causes; when acid substances,
particularly saline bodies, have been taken into the stomach; and, in short,
in every condition of the system, which favors the inordinate excretion of fluids.
The immediate cause of thirst appears to be a dry state of the mouth and fauces;
owing to the mucus which covers these parts becoming thick and viscid, though
physiologists are not agreed on this point. This may arise from the absorption
of the fluid parts of the saliva; for it appears to be necessary for the due performance
of the functions of the palate and the tongue, that the mucus should possess a
certain degree of liquidity. The sensation of thirst is generally indicative of the
necessity of a supply of fluid to the system generally; for although thirst may be
momentarily assuaged by wetting the mouth, or holding a thin fluid in it—yet it
can only be effectually relieved by conveying into the stomach a quantity of fluid
sufficient to supply the deficiency. This supply is termed <i>dilution</i>, from the fact
that the fluid is absorbed and carried into the blood, which it renders thin, and the
fluids themselves are called <i>diluents</i>.</p>

<p>Thirst, however, does not always indicate a deficiency of fluids in the circulating
mass, and the tongue and fauces are occasionally dry and harsh whilst
the sensation of thirst is absent. Some individuals never experience the sensation
of thirst. Mr. Alcott, who lives entirely on succulent vegetables, states that
he has drunk no fluids for more than a year past, and that he never experiences
the sensation of thirst—a similar case is mentioned by Sauvages, of an individual
who never thirsted, and passed whole months of the hottest weather without
drinking. It is well known that many warm-blooded animals such as mice,
quails, parrots, rabbits, &amp;c., drink but very little; which is supposed to be owing to
the circumstance that they have very large salivary glands, and a larger pancreas in
proportion to the size of their bodies. In general, as we have already remarked,
thirst is indicative of diminished fluidity of the blood and when it is not assuaged by
taking liquids into the stomach, or by moistening the mouth with them, or by applying
them to the surface, the torment which it induces amounts occasionally almost
to phrenzy, and is borne with less patience and greater difficulty than hunger; sometimes
inflammation of the mouth and throat and intense fever supervene. Various
circumstances connected with the ordinary condition of the body influence the sensation
of thirst. Thus it is greater in infancy and childhood than in adult age, and
less in old age; it is greater in women than in men; it is varied by constitution and
temperament; by climate; season; the nature of the diet; exercise; passions of
mind, and even by imagination. As an <i>aliment</i>, water is of prime necessity to all
organized beings. As a solvent, it reduces to a fluid mass all the principles necessary
for the growth of animal and vegetable bodies; which must be in a fluid form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
before they can be taken up by the fine lacteal and other absorbent vessels, and thus
carried to every part of the living tissue. How important then, that this universal
solvent should be pure,—that it should be free from those foreign ingredients, whether
of animal, vegetable or mineral origin, which, if introduced into the system,
tend to disturb the functions of the various organs, and often to occasion serious
derangement and disease. But besides its important office as a <i>menstruum</i>, water
is perhaps the most important <i>nutrient</i>, of all those which sustain the existence of
organized bodies. A great proportion of that which is drunk, is speedily absorbed
by the veins, and carried into the circulation, some time before the product of the
digested food is introduced by the way of the laeteals. There are numerous cases
on record, where persons have lived, for a considerable length of time, on water
alone. In the “Transactions of the Albany Institute,” for 1830, Dr. M’Naughten
relates the case of a man who was sustained on water alone, for 53 days. “For the
first six weeks he walked out every day, and sometimes spent a great part of the day
in the woods. His walk was steady and firm, and his friends even remarked that
his step had an unusual elasticity; he shaved himself until about a week before his
death, and was able to sit up in bed till the last day.”</p>

<p>To the evils which result from the use of impure water, we have already alluded,
although it would require far more space than has been assigned to us in this
Appendix, to do them adequate justice. There can be no doubt, that the chief
cause of the excess of mortality in cities, over that of the country, is to be found
in the impure water, with which the former are so generally supplied, and we may
confidently predict, that in consequence mainly of the introduction of the Croton
River into the City of New-York, no city in the world of equal size, will surpass it
in salubrity. To the operation of the same cause, we may doubtless look with
confidence for a decided improvement in personal comeliness and beauty. “It is
evident,” says Dr Jackson, “that the health of a whole community may be so
affected by impurities in water drank by them, as to give a peculiar morbid expression
to their countenances which causes the observant eye of a traveller to
remark it, while he in vain endeavours to account for the phenomenon. Who has
not remarked the expression common in some of our cities, as in New-York and
Boston, which is called a “care worn and anxious expression.” This expression
I will venture to assert, is not so much the result of “too much care,” as it is of
abdominal disease, produced by the habitual and continued use of impure and unwholesome
water, which has fixed upon us this morbid stamp. I do not know that
the people of the cities in question, are subject to more care than those in other
districts, but I do know that they use every day, in many forms, a variety of noxous
ingredients, which they pump up from their wells, dissolved in the water, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
which enters into every form of food and drink they use in their houses.” Mrs.
Hale, also, in her excellent Manual “The Good Housekeeper,” remarks, that “hard
water always leaves a mineral matter on the skin, when we use it in washing,
which renders the hands and face rough and liable to chap. Does not this water,
if we drink it, likewise corrode and injure the fine membranes of the stomach? The
Boston people, who constantly use hard water for all purposes of cookery and
drink, certainly have bad complexions, sallow, dry, and <i>hard</i> looking; and complaints
of the stomach or dyspepsia are very common among them.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> A Salem
gentleman declared, that when his daughters, who frequently visited at Boston,
passed two or three weeks at a time there, he could see a very material change in
their complexions. At Salem there is plenty of soft water, and the ladies of that
ancient town are famed for their beauty, which is chiefly owing (its superiority I
mean) to a peculiarly fair, delicate tincture of skin contrasted with the half petrified
appearance of those who are obliged to drink <i>hard water</i> always, and often
to wash in it.” Such authority on this point we presume will not be disputed.</p>

<p>Health, however, is no less promoted by the internal, than by the external use of
water; and it is to be hoped, that but a short period will elapse, before free baths
will be provided at the public expense, for the use of the poor, as well as the public
generally. Daily ablution should be regarded as necessary as daily food or sleep.</p>

<p>The advantages which soft water possesses over hard, in the thousand economical
purposes of life, are too obvious to need particular remark. The lime contained in
well water, renders it inapplicable to the purposes of brewing, tanning, washing,
bleaching, and many other processes in the arts and domestic economy; and we
believe the calculation would not be found extravagant, if we should say that by the
use of the Croton water 100,000 dollars annually will be saved to the inhabitants of
New-York, in the articles of soap and soda alone. When to this, we add the increased
comfort and health of the citizens, from its free external and internal use,—the
superior cleanliness of the streets, by the washing away of all stagnant matters
in the sinks and gutters, and the consequent purity of the atmosphere,—the diminution
of danger from fires, and the consequent reduction of rates of insurance, with
other important advantages too numerous to detail, we shall not consider its introduction
purchased at too dear a rate, even were the expenses attending it increased
to double the actual amount.</p>

<p>We need not attempt to specify in detail the benefits which are likely to accrue to
the city of New-York from the introduction of an abundance of pure water. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
value is not to be estimated by dollars and cents; though it might easily be shown,
that it already saves to the citizens a sum far exceeding the annual interest on its
cost. We have already referred to its superiority as a solvent of vegetable matter,
over the hard well water, formerly used. Since then, we have made a calculation,
by which we are satisfied that in the single items of tea and coffee, it will save to
the inhabitants of this city annually, not far from 90,000 dollars. To this may be
added the improvement of the public health, and the consequent saving in medicine,
and physicians’ fees, a sum probably exceeding that above specified; the increase
of the working days, and the extension of the average period of working ability
among the laboring classes; and lastly, the moral and intellectual advancement of
the entire population, attendant upon the improvement of their physical condition;
each of which is not an unimportant item in the aggregate of public prosperity and
happiness.</p>

<p>Such are some of the facts connected with this important fluid—water. So common
and abundant is it in nature, that we are apt to overlook its value; but we
need only be deprived of it for a season, when we shall set a due estimate upon its
importance. Pure and sparkling to the eye, bland and refreshing to the taste, whether
it bubbles up from mother earth, gurgles in rills, flows along in streams and
rivers, or spreads out in lakes and oceans, it every where proves a blessing,—and
ought to be universally regarded as one of the most inestimable gifts of Providence
to man. As it is the only fluid capable of quenching thirst, so it is the only one
compatible with the prolonged duration of animal life—we need not add, that as
<span class="allsmcap">ALCOHOL</span>, under all its combinations, fermented and distilled, is a deadly poison, fatal
to organized beings, whether they belong to the vegetable or animal kingdom,
<span class="allsmcap">WATER</span> can in no case be improved by combining it with this deleterious fluid. It
was formerly common in this city, and still is so in many places where the well-water
is brackish, to modify its taste by the addition of a quantity of brandy, or
some other form of ardent spirit, with a view, not only of rendering it more agreeable
to the palate, but also of correcting the deleterious properties, occasioned by
the salts held by it in solution. But in all such instances, the spirit which is added
proves far more injurious than the small quantity of vegetable and mineral matters
which it is designed to correct. To the latter, the system becomes in a manner
habituated, so that even when pure soft water can be had, the former is often preferred,
as is now the case with many individuals, who prefer our brackish well water
to that of the Croton. But where ardent spirit is added, an artificial appetite for
stimulants is soon created,—there is a constantly increasing demand for a repetition
as well as increase of the dose, derangement of the digestive organs succeeds, and in
a large majority of instances, the health is irremediably impaired. But fortunately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
no arguments are needed in this place to convince the citizens of New-York that
pure Croton water needs no corrective,—and that it is the sworn enemy of <i>fire</i>,
whether in the shape of alcoholic poison, or that of the more simple <span class="locked">element—</span></p>

drawn fresh from the well,” says Mr. Youatt, “will assuredly make the coat of a horse unaccustomed to it
stare, and it will not unfrequently gripe, and otherwise injure him. Instinct, or experience, has made
even the horse himself conscious of this; for he will never drink hard water, if he has access to soft; he
will leave the most transparent water of the well, for the river, although the water may be turbid, and
even for the muddiest pool. Some trainers have so much fear of hard or strange water, that they carry
with them to the different courses the water that the animal has been accustomed to drink and what they
know agrees with it.”</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
